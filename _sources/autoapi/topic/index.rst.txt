   Extracts an element with a file into a temporary directory

   These include header files, bim snippets, document references, and
   viewpoint bitmaps. External reference are not downloaded. Instead, the
   URI reference is returned.

   :param entity: The entity with a file reference to extract
   :param outfile: If provided, save the header file to that location.
       Otherwise, a temporary directory is created and the filename is
       derived from the header's original filename.
   :param bcfxml: The BCF XML file to use for resolving document references files.
       Required only for BCF v3 document references (in BCF v3 internal documents
       are stored at BCF root, not in the topic).
   :return: The filepath of the extracted file. It may be a URL if the
       header file is external.
