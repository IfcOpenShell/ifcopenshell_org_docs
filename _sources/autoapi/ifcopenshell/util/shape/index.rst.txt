   :param vertices: An iterable of vertices
   :type: iterable
   :return: The bounding box value represented as a tuple of two numpy arrays.
       The first holds the bottom left corner and the second holds the top

       maxz]))
   :rtype: tuple[np.array[float]]

.. py:function:: get_element_vertices(element: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, geometry) -> numpy.typing.NDArray[numpy.float64]

   Get the element's vertices as a numpy array

   Vertices are in global coordinates. Note that if you have the shape, it is

.. py:function:: get_faces(geometry) -> numpy.typing.NDArray[numpy.int32]

   Get all the faces as a numpy array

   Faces are always triangulated. If the shape is a BRep and you want to get
   the original untriangulated output, refer to ``get_edges``.

.. py:function:: get_footprint_area(geometry, axis: AXIS_LITERAL = 'Z', direction: Optional[VECTOR_3D] = None) -> float

   This is typically useful for calculating footprint areas. For example, you
   might want to calculate the top-down footprint area of a slab, ignoring
   slopes in the slab.

   Surfaces do not need to be exactly perpendicular in the direction of the
   specified axis. A surface is counted so long as it is visible from that
   axis.

   Note that this calculates the 2D projected area, not the actual surface
   area. If you want the actual area, use ``get_side_area``.

   :param geometry: Geometry output calculated by IfcOpenShell
   :type geometry: geometry
   :param axis: Either X, Y, or Z. Defaults to Z.
   :type axis: str,optional
   :param direction: An XYZ iterable (e.g. (0., 0., 1.)). If a direction
       vector is specified, this overrides the axis argument.
   :type axis: iterable[float],optional
   :return: The surface area.
   :rtype: float


.. py:function:: get_footprint_perimeter(geometry) -> float

   This is typically useful for calculating painted areas of beams which
   exclude the end faces (at the minimum and maximum local Z).

   :param geometry: Geometry output calculated by IfcOpenShell
   :type geometry: geometry
   :return: The surface area.
   :rtype: float


.. py:function:: get_profiles(element: ifcopenshell.entity_instance) -> list[ifcopenshell.entity_instance]

   Gets all 2D profiles used in the definition of a parametric shape

   Profiles may be retrieved either from material profile sets or from swept
   solid extrusions. This is useful for later doing 2D take-off from profiles.

   :param element: The element occurrence
   :type: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
   :return: A list of profiles
   :rtype: list[ifcopenshell.entity_instance]

   :rtype: MatrixType


.. py:function:: get_shape_top_elevation(shape, geometry) -> float

   Gets the highest global Z ordinate of the shape

.. py:function:: get_side_area(geometry, axis: AXIS_LITERAL = 'Y', direction: Optional[VECTOR_3D] = None) -> float

   Calculates the total surface area of surfaces that are visible from the specified axis

   This is typically useful for calculating elevational areas. For example,
   you might want to calculate the side area of a wall (i.e. only one side,
   not both).

   Surfaces do not need to be exactly perpendicular in the direction of the
   specified axis. A surface is counted so long as it is visible from that
   axis.

   Note that this calculates the actual area, not the projected 2D area. If
   you want the projected area, use ``get_footprint_area``.

   :type geometry: geometry
