.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Reads and writes encoded GlobalIds

   IFC entities may be identified using a unique ID (called a UUID or GUID). This
   128-bit label is often represented in the form
   xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx. However, in IFC, it is also usually
   stored as a 22 character base 64 encoded string. This module lets you convert
   between these representations and generate new UUIDs.
