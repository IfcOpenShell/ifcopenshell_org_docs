.. py:function:: edit_wcs(file: ifcopenshell.file, x: float = 0.0, y: float = 0.0, z: float = 0.0, rotation: float = 0.0, is_si: bool = True) -> None

   Edits the WCS for all geometric contexts to a translation and rotation

   Typically, a project's local engineering origin (0, 0, 0) has a coordinate
   operation (e.g. map conversion) to a projected CRS. If a WCS is provided,
   the coordinate operation is relative to the WCS, not the local engineering
   origin.

   For example, if I have an IfcSite with a placement at (10, 0, 0) and a map
   conversion of (50, 0, 0), my IfcSite's local XYZ is at (10, 0, 0) with an
   ENH (Easting, Northing, Height) of (60, 0, 0).

   If I then define by WCS at (15, 0, 0), my IfcSite's local XYZ is still at
   (10, 0, 0) but its ENH is now at (45, 0, 0).

   It's recommended to leave the WCS at 0,0,0. Please :)

   :param x: The X translation of the WCS
   :param y: The Y translation of the WCS
   :param z: The Z translation of the WCS
   :param rotation: The rotation around the Z axis (i.e. top down plan view)
       in decimal degrees of the WCS. Anticlockwise is positive.

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # This is the simplest scenario, resetting the WCS to 0,0,0 with no rotation (recommended)
       ifcopenshell.api.georeference.edit_wcs(model)
