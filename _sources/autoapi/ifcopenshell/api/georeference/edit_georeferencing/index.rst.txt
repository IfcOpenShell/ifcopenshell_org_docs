.. py:function:: edit_georeferencing(file: ifcopenshell.file, coordinate_operation: Optional[dict[str, Any]] = None, projected_crs: Optional[dict[str, Any]] = None) -> None

   Edits the attributes of a map conversion, projected CRS, and true north

   Setting the correct georeferencing parameters is a complex topic and
   should ideally be done with three parties present: the lead architect,
   surveyor, and a third-party digital engineer with expertise in IFC to
   moderate. For more information, read the BlenderBIM Add-on documentation
   for Georeferencing:
   https://docs.blenderbim.org/users/georeferencing.html

   For more information about the attributes and data types of an
   IfcCoordinateOperation, consult the IFC documentation.

   For more information about the attributes and data types of an
   IfcProjectedCRS, consult the IFC documentation.

   See ifcopenshell.util.geolocation for more utilities to convert to and
   from local and map coordinates to check your results.

   :param coordinate_operation: The dictionary of attribute names and values
       you want to edit.
   :param projected_crs: The IfcProjectedCRS dictionary of attribute
       names and values you want to edit.

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       ifcopenshell.api.georeference.add_georeferencing(model)
       # This is the simplest scenario, a defined CRS (GDA2020 / MGA Zone
       # 56, typically used in Sydney, Australia) but with no local
       # coordinates. This is only recommended for horizontal construction
       # projects, not for vertical construction (such as buildings).
       ifcopenshell.api.georeference.edit_georeferencing(model,
           projected_crs={"Name": "EPSG:7856"})

       # For buildings, it is almost always recommended to specify map
       # conversion parameters to a false origin and orientation to project
       # north. See the diagram in the BlenderBIM Add-on Georeferencing
       # documentation for correct calculation of the X Axis Abcissa and
       # Ordinate.
       ifcopenshell.api.georeference.edit_georeferencing(model,
           projected_crs={"Name": "EPSG:7856"},
           coordinate_operation={
               "Eastings": 335087.17, # The architect nominates a false origin
               "Northings": 6251635.41, # The architect nominates a false origin
               # Note: this is the angle difference between Project North
               # and Grid North. Remember: True North should never be used!
               "XAxisAbscissa": cos(radians(-30)), # The architect nominates a project north
               "XAxisOrdinate": sin(radians(-30)), # The architect nominates a project north
               "Scale": 0.99956, # Ask your surveyor for your site's average combined scale factor!
           })
