.. py:function:: add_georeferencing(file) -> None

   Add empty georeferencing entities to a model

   By default, models are not georeferenced. Georeferencing requires two
   entities: a definition of the projected coordinated reference system
   (CRS) used, and the transformation parameters between any local coordinate
   system and that projected CRS if any.

   This function will create the entities to store the projected CRS and
   map conversion transformation, but will leave all the parameters blank.
   It is this the users responsibility to specify the correct
   georeferencing parameters. See
   ifcopenshell.api.georeference.edit_georeferencing.

   :return: None
   :rtype: None

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       ifcopenshell.api.run("georeference.add_georeferencing", model)


.. py:function:: edit_georeferencing(file, map_conversion=None, projected_crs=None, true_north=None) -> None

   Edits the attributes of a map conversion, projected CRS, and true north

   Setting the correct georeferencing parameters is a complex topic and
   should ideally be done with three parties present: the lead architect,
   surveyor, and a third-party digital engineer with expertise in IFC to
   moderate. For more information, read the BlenderBIM Add-on documentation
   for Georeferencing:
   https://docs.blenderbim.org/users/georeferencing.html

   For more information about the attributes and data types of an
   IfcMapConversion, consult the IFC documentation.

   For more information about the attributes and data types of an
   IfcProjectedCRS, consult the IFC documentation.

   True north is defined as a unitised 2D vector pointing to true north.
   Note that true north is not part of georeferencing, and is only
   optionally provided as a reference value, typically for solar analysis.

   See ifcopenshell.util.geolocation for more utilities to convert to and
   from local and map coordinates to check your results.

   :param map_conversion: The IfcMapConversion dictionary of attribute
       names and values you want to edit.
   :type map_conversion: dict, optional
   :param projected_crs: The IfcProjectedCRS dictionary of attribute
       names and values you want to edit.
   :type projected_crs: dict, optional
   :param true_north: A unitised 2D vector, where each ordinate is a float
   :type true_north: list[float]
   :return: None
   :rtype: None

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       ifcopenshell.api.run("georeference.add_georeferencing", model)
       # This is the simplest scenario, a defined CRS (GDA2020 / MGA Zone
       # 56, typically used in Sydney, Australia) but with no local
       # coordinates. This is only recommended for horizontal construction
       # projects, not for vertical construction (such as buildings).
       ifcopenshell.api.run("georeference.edit_georeferencing", model,
           projected_crs={"Name": "EPSG:7856"})

       # For buildings, it is almost always recommended to specify map
       # conversion parameters to a false origin and orientation to project
       # north. See the diagram in the BlenderBIM Add-on Georeferencing
       # documentation for correct calculation of the X Axis Abcissa and
       # Ordinate.
       ifcopenshell.api.run("georeference.edit_georeferencing", model,
           projected_crs={"Name": "EPSG:7856"},
           map_conversion={
               "Eastings": 335087.17, # The architect nominates a false origin
               "Northings": 6251635.41, # The architect nominates a false origin
               # Note: this is the angle difference between Project North
               # and Grid North. Remember: True North should never be used!
               "XAxisAbscissa": cos(radians(-30)), # The architect nominates a project north
               "XAxisOrdinate": sin(radians(-30)), # The architect nominates a project north
               "Scale": 0.99956, # Ask your surveyor for your site's average combined scale factor!
           })


.. py:function:: remove_georeferencing(file) -> None

   Remove georeferencing data

   All georeferencing parameters such as projected CRS and map conversion
   data will be lost.

   :return: None
   :rtype: None

   Example:

       ifcopenshell.api.run("georeference.add_georeferencing", model)
       # Let's change our mind
       ifcopenshell.api.run("georeference.remove_georeferencing", model)
