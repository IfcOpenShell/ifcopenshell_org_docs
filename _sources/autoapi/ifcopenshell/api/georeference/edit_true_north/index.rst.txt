.. py:function:: edit_true_north(file: ifcopenshell.file, true_north: Optional[Union[tuple[float, float], float]] = 0.0) -> None

   Edits the true north

   Given project north being up (i.e. a vector of 0, 1), true north is defined
   as a unitised 2D vector pointing to true north. Alternatively, true north
   may be defined as a rotation from project north to true north.
   Anticlockwise is positive.

   Note that true north is not part of georeferencing, and is only optionally
   provided as a reference value, typically for solar analysis. Remember: grid
   north (what your surveyor will typically use) is not the same as true
   north!

   :param true_north: A unitised 2D vector, where each ordinate is a float, or
       an angle in decimal degrees where anticlockwise is positive.

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # Both of these are identical, and indicate that:
       # - If project north is up the page, true north is in the top left
       # - The building is therefore facing north east
       ifcopenshell.api.georeference.edit_true_north(model, true_north=30)
       ifcopenshell.api.georeference.edit_true_north(model, true_north=(-0.5, 0.8660254))

       # This unsets true north
       ifcopenshell.api.georeference.edit_true_north(model, true_north=None)
