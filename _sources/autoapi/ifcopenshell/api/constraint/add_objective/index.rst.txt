   Add a new objective constraint

   Parametric constraints may be defined by the user. The constraint is defined
   by first creating an objective describing the purpose of the constraint and
   whether it is a hard or soft constraint. Later on, metrics may be added to
   check whether the constraint has been met by connecting it to properties and
   quantities. See ifcopenshell.api.constraint.add_metric for more information.

   :return: The newly created IfcObjective entity

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # Create a new objective for code compliance requirements
       objective = ifcopenshell.api.constraint.add_objective(model)
       objective.ConstraintGrade = "ADVISORY"
       objective.ObjectiveQualifier = "CODECOMPLIANCE"
       # Note: the objective right now is purely qualitative and for
       # information purposes. You may wish to add quantiative metrics.
