   Assigns a constraint to a list of products

   This assigns a relationship between a product and a constraint, so that
   when a product's properties and quantities do not match the requirements
   of the constraint's metrics, results can be flagged.

   It is assumed (but not explicit in the IFC documentation) that
   constraints are inherited from the type. This way, it is not necessary
   to create lots of constraint assignments.

   :param products: The list of products the constraint applies to. This is anything
       which can have properties or quantities.
   :type products: list[ifcopenshell.entity_instance]
   :param constraint: The IfcObjective constraint
   :type constraint: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
   :return: The new or updated IfcRelAssociatesConstraint relationship
       or `None` if `products` was an empty list.
   :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
