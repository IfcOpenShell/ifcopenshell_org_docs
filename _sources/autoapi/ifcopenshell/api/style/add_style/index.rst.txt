   Add a new presentation style

   A presentation style is a container of visual settings (called
   presentation items) that affect the appearance of objects. There are
   four types of style:

   - Surface styles, which give 3D objects (which have surfaces / faces)
     their colours and textures. This is the most common type of style.
   - Curve styles, which give 2D and 3D curves, lines, polylines, their
     stroke thickness and colour.
   - Fill area styles, which gives 2D polygons and flat 3D planes their
     colours, hatch patterns, tiled patterns, and pattern scales.
   - Text styles, which gives text their font family, weight, variant,
     size, indentation, alignment, decoration, spacing, and transformation.

   Once you have created a presentation style object, you can further
   define the properties of your style using other API functions by adding
   presentation items, such as ifcopenshell.api.style.add_surface_style.

   :param name: The name of the style. Used to easily identify it using a
       style library.
   :param ifc_class: Choose from IfcSurfaceStyle, IfcCurveStyle,
       IfcFillAreaStyle, or IfcTextStyle.
   :return: The newly created style element, based on the provided
       ifc_class.

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # Create a new surface style
       style = ifcopenshell.api.style.add_style(model)
