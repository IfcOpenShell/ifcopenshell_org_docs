   Assigns a style directly to an object representation

   A style may either be assigned directly to an object's representation,
   or to a material which is then associated with the object. If both
   exist, then the style assigned directly to the object's representation
   takes precedence. It is recommended to use materials and assign styles
   to materials. However, sometimes you may want to assign colours directly
   to the object representation as an override. This API function provides
   that capability.

   This function assigns styles in bulk in an ordered manner to every item in
   the representation, so the order and total styles provided is significant.
   If you want more granular control, use
   :func:`ifcopenshell.api.style.assign_item_style`.

   If you want to assign styles to a material instead (recommended), then
   please see ifcopenshell.api.style.assign_material_style.

   :param shape_representation: The IfcShapeRepresentation of the object
       that you want to assign styles to. This implicitly defines the
       context at which the styles should be used.
   :param styles: A list of presentation styles, typically IfcSurfaceStyle.
       The number of items in the list should correlate with the number of
       items in the shape_representation's Items attribute. If you have
       more items than styles, the last style is used.
   :param replace_previous_same_type_style: Remove previously assigned styles
       of the same type as currently assign style`. Defaults to `True`.
   :param should_use_presentation_style_assignment: This is a technical
       detail to accomodate a bug in Revit. This should always be left as
       the default of False, unless you are finding that colours aren't
       showing up in Revit. In that case, set it to True, but keep in mind
       that this is no longer a valid IFC. Blame Autodesk.
   :return: List of created IfcStyledItems

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # A model context is needed to store 3D geometry
       model3d = ifcopenshell.api.context.add_context(model, context_type="Model")

       # Specifically, we want to store body geometry
       body = ifcopenshell.api.context.add_context(model,
           context_type="Model", context_identifier="Body", target_view="MODEL_VIEW", parent=model3d)

       # Let's create a new wall. The wall does not have any geometry yet.
       wall = ifcopenshell.api.root.create_entity(model, ifc_class="IfcWall")

       # Let's use the "3D Body" representation we created earlier to add a
       # new wall-like body geometry, 5 meters long, 3 meters high, and
       # 200mm thick
       representation = ifcopenshell.api.geometry.add_wall_representation(model,
           context=body, length=5, height=3, thickness=0.2)

       # Assign our new body geometry back to our wall
       ifcopenshell.api.geometry.assign_representation(model,
           product=wall, representation=representation)

       # Place our wall at the origin
       ifcopenshell.api.geometry.edit_object_placement(model, product=wall)

       # Create a new surface style
       style = ifcopenshell.api.style.add_style(model)

       # Create a simple grey shading colour and transparency.
       ifcopenshell.api.style.add_surface_style(model,
           style=style, ifc_class="IfcSurfaceStyleShading", attributes={
               "SurfaceColour": { "Name": None, "Red": 0.5, "Green": 0.5, "Blue": 0.5 },
               "Transparency": 0., # 0 is opaque, 1 is transparent
           })

       # Now specifically our wall only will be coloured grey.
       ifcopenshell.api.style.assign_representation_styles(model,
           shape_representation=representation, styles=[style])
