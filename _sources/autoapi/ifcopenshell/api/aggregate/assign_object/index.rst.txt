   Assigns an object as an aggregate to a product

   All physical IFC model elements must be part of a hierarchical tree
   called the "spatial decomposition", where large things are made up of
   smaller things. This tree always begins at an "IfcProject" and is then
   broken down using "decomposition" relationships, of which aggregation is
   the first relationship you will use.

   Typically used when you want to describe how large spaces are made up of
   smaller spaces. For example large spatial elements (e.g. sites,
   buidings) can be made out of smaller spatial elements (e.g. storeys,
   spaces).

   The largest space (typically the IfcSite) can then be aggregated in a
   project. It is requirement for all spatial structures to be directly or
   indirectly aggregated back to the IfcProject to create a hierarchy of
   spaces.

   The other common usecase is when larger physical products are made up of
   smaller physical products. For example, a stair might be made out of a
   flight, a landing, a railing and so on. Or a wall might be made out of
   stud members, and coverings.

   As a product may only have a single location in the "spatial
   decomposition" tree, assigning an aggregate relationship will remove any
   previous aggregation, containment, or nesting relationships it may have.

   IFC placements follow a convention where the placement is relative to
   its parent in the spatial hierarchy. If your product has a placement,
   its placement will be recalculated to follow this convention.

   :param product: The part of the aggregate, typically an IfcElement or
       IfcSpatialStructureElement subclass
   :type product: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance
   :param relating_object: The whole of the aggregate, typically an
       IfcElement or IfcSpatialStructureElement subclass
   :type relating_object: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance
   :return: The IfcRelAggregate relationship instance
   :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       project = ifcopenshell.api.run("root.create_entity", model, ifc_class="IfcProject")
       element = ifcopenshell.api.run("root.create_entity", model, ifc_class="IfcSite")
       subelement = ifcopenshell.api.run("root.create_entity", model, ifc_class="IfcBuilding")

       # The project contains a site (note that project aggregation is a special case in IFC)
       ifcopenshell.api.run("aggregate.assign_object", model, product=element, relating_object=project)

       # The site has a building
       ifcopenshell.api.run("aggregate.assign_object", model, product=subelement, relating_object=element)
