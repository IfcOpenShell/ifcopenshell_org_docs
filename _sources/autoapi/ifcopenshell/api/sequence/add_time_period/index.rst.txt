.. py:function:: add_time_period(file: ifcopenshell.file, recurrence_pattern: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, start_time: Optional[Union[str, datetime.time]] = None, end_time: Optional[Union[str, datetime.time]] = None) -> ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Adds a time period to a recurrence pattern

   A recurring time may be an all-day event, or only during certain time
   periods of the day. For example, you might say that every 1st of January
   recurring is a public holiday, which is an all-day event. Alternatively,
   you might say that you work every (i.e. recurringly) Monday to Friday,
   from 9am to 5pm. The 9am to 5pm is the time period.

   There may also be multiple recurrence patterns, such as from 9am to
   12pm, and then another from 1pm to 5pm (to indicate an hour break for
   lunch).

   :param recurrence_pattern: The IfcRecurrencePattern to add the time
       period to. See ifcopenshell.api.sequence.assign_recurrence_pattern.
   :param start_time: The start time of the time period, in a format
       compatible with IfcTime, such as an ISO format time string or a
       datetime.time object.
   :param end_time: The end time of the time period, in a format
       compatible with IfcTime, such as an ISO format time string or a
       datetime.time object.
   :return: The newly created IfcTimePeriod

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # Let's create a new calendar.
       calendar = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_calendar(model)

       # Let's start defining the times that we work during the week.
       work_time = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_time(model,
           work_calendar=calendar, time_type="WorkingTimes")

       # We create a weekly recurrence
       pattern = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.assign_recurrence_pattern(model,
           parent=work_time, recurrence_type="WEEKLY")

       # State that we work from weekdays 1 to 5 (i.e. Monday to Friday)
       ifcopenshell.api.sequence.edit_recurrence_pattern(model,
           recurrence_pattern=pattern, attributes={"WeekdayComponent": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]})

       # The morning work session, lunch, then the afternoon work session.
       ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_time_period(model,
           recurrence_pattern=pattern, start_time="09:00", end_time="12:00")
       ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_time_period(model,
           recurrence_pattern=pattern, start_time="13:00", end_time="17:00")
