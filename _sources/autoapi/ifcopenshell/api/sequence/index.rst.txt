.. py:function:: add_date_time(file: ifcopenshell.file, dt: datetime.datetime) -> Union[str, ifcopenshell.entity_instance]

   Add a new date time.

   Depending on ``file``'s schema method will:
   - IFC2X3 - create IfcDateAndTime entity
   - IFC4+  - create IfcDatetime formatted string

   :param dt: datetime to convert to IFC.
   :return: IfcDateAndTime entity or IfcDatetime string.

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       dt = datetime(2025, 3, 1, 12, 31, 24)
       datetime_ifc = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_date_time(self.file, dt)

       # IFC2X3: #1=IfcDateAndTime(#2,#3)
       # IFC4+: "2025-03-01T12:31:24"
       print(datetime_ifc)



.. py:function:: add_task(file: ifcopenshell.file, work_schedule: Optional[ifcopenshell.entity_instance] = None, parent_task: Optional[ifcopenshell.entity_instance] = None, name: Optional[str] = None, description: Optional[str] = None, identification: Optional[str] = None, predefined_type: str = 'NOTDEFINED') -> ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Adds a new task

   Tasks are typically used for two purposes: construction scheduling and
   facility management.

   In construction scheduling, a task represents a job to be done in a work
   schedule. Tasks are organised in a hierarchical manner known as a work
   breakdown structure (WBS) and have lots of sequential relationships
   (e.g. this task must finish before the next task can start) and date
   information (e.g. durations, start dates). This is often represented as
   a gantt chart and used to analyse critical paths to try and reduce
   project time to stay on-time and within budget.

   In facility management, a task represents a maintenance task to maintain
   a piece of equipment. Tasks are broken down into a punch list, or simply
   a bulleted or ordered sequence of tasks to be performed (e.g. turn off
   equipment, check power connection, etc) in order to maintain the
   equipment. Tasks will also typically have recurring scheduled dates in
   line with the maintenance schedule. These maintenance tasks and
   procedures are typically published as part of an operations and
   maintenance manual.

   All tasks must be grouped in a work schedule, either directly as a root
   or top-level task, or indirectly as a child or subtask of a parent task.
   In construction scheduling, tasks may be nested many times to create the
   work breakdown structure, and the "leaf" tasks (i.e. tasks with no more
   subtasks) are considered to be the activities with dates, whereas all
   parent tasks are part of the breakdown structure used for categorisation
   purposes. In facility management, top-level tasks represent the overall
   maintenance job to be performed, and child tasks represent an ordered
   list of things to do for that maintenance. These form a 2-level
   hierarchy. No further child tasks are recommended.

   :param work_schedule: The work schedule to group the task in, if the
       task is to be a top-level or root task. This is mutually exclusive
       with the parent_task parameter.
   :param parent_task: The parent task, if the task is to be a subtask or
       child task. This is mutually exclusive with the work_schedule
       parameter.
   :param name: The name of the task.
   :param description: The description of the task.
   :param identification: The identification code of the task.
   :param predefined_type: The predefined type of the task. Common ones
       include CONSTRUCTION, DEMOLITION, or MAINTENANCE. Consultant the
       IFC documentation for IfcTaskTypeEnum for more information.
   :return: The newly created IfcTask

.. py:function:: add_task_time(file: ifcopenshell.file, task: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, is_recurring: bool = False) -> ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Adds a task time to a task

   Some tasks, such as activities within a work breakdown structure or
   overall maintenance tasks will have time related information. This
   includes start dates, durations, end dates, and possible recurring times
   (especially for maintenance tasks).

   :param task: The task to add time data to.
   :param is_recurring: Whether or not the time should recur.
   :return: The newly created IfcTaskTime.

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # Let's imagine we are creating a construction schedule.
       schedule = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_schedule(model, name="Construction Schedule A")

       # Create a portion of a work breakdown structure.
       construction = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_task(model,
           work_schedule=schedule, name="Construction", identification="C")
       superstructure = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_task(model,
           parent_task=construction, name="Superstructure", identification="C3")
       task = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_task(model,
           parent_task=superstructure, name="Ground Floor FRP", identification="C3.1")

       # Add time data. Note that time data is blank by default.
       time = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_task_time(model, task=task)

       # Let's say our task starts on the first of January when everybody
       # is still drunk from the new years celebration, and lasts for 2
       # days. Note we don't need to specify the end date, as that is
       # derived from the start plus the duration. In this simple example,
       # no calendar has been specified, so we are working 24/7. Yikes!
       ifcopenshell.api.sequence.edit_task_time(model,
           task_time=time, attributes={"ScheduleStart": "2000-01-01", "ScheduleDuration": "P2D"})


.. py:function:: add_time_period(file: ifcopenshell.file, recurrence_pattern: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, start_time: Optional[Union[str, datetime.time]] = None, end_time: Optional[Union[str, datetime.time]] = None) -> ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Adds a time period to a recurrence pattern

   A recurring time may be an all-day event, or only during certain time
   periods of the day. For example, you might say that every 1st of January
   recurring is a public holiday, which is an all-day event. Alternatively,
   you might say that you work every (i.e. recurringly) Monday to Friday,
   from 9am to 5pm. The 9am to 5pm is the time period.

   There may also be multiple recurrence patterns, such as from 9am to
   12pm, and then another from 1pm to 5pm (to indicate an hour break for
   lunch).

   :param recurrence_pattern: The IfcRecurrencePattern to add the time
       period to. See ifcopenshell.api.sequence.assign_recurrence_pattern.
   :param start_time: The start time of the time period, in a format
       compatible with IfcTime, such as an ISO format time string or a
       datetime.time object.
   :param end_time: The end time of the time period, in a format
       compatible with IfcTime, such as an ISO format time string or a
       datetime.time object.
   :return: The newly created IfcTimePeriod

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # Let's create a new calendar.
       calendar = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_calendar(model)

       # Let's start defining the times that we work during the week.
       work_time = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_time(model,
           work_calendar=calendar, time_type="WorkingTimes")

       # We create a weekly recurrence
       pattern = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.assign_recurrence_pattern(model,
           parent=work_time, recurrence_type="WEEKLY")

       ifcopenshell.api.sequence.edit_recurrence_pattern(model,
           recurrence_pattern=pattern, attributes={"WeekdayComponent": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]})

       # The morning work session, lunch, then the afternoon work session.
       ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_time_period(model,
           recurrence_pattern=pattern, start_time="09:00", end_time="12:00")

.. py:function:: add_work_calendar(file: ifcopenshell.file, name: str = 'Unnamed', predefined_type: str = 'NOTDEFINED') -> ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Add a work calendar

   A work calendar defines when work is allowed to occur and when the
   holidays are. This is a fundamental concept in construction planning.
   Every task in a work schedule will have an associated calendar. Some
   task and resources work 24/7, whereas others work Monday to Friday, or
   5.5 day weeks, etc. This is important, as tasks durations may only occur
   during working times in a work calendar.

   Work calendars can also be used to associate with events, such as
   indicating that during certain days and times of the year, motion
   sensors should turn on the lights, and other smart building controls.

   :param name: The name of the calendar. Typically something like
       "5 Day Working Week" or "24/7".
   :param predefined_type: The type of calendar, typically used to more
       specifically define shifts, such as FIRSTSHIFT, SECONDSHIFT, or
       THIRDSHIFT. Leave as NOTDEFINED for basic calendar usage.
   :return: The newly created IfcWorkCalendar

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # Let's imagine we are creating a construction schedule. All tasks
       # need to be part of a work schedule.
       schedule = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_schedule(model, name="Construction Schedule A")

       # Add a root task to represent the construction tasks.
       task = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_task(model,
           work_schedule=schedule, name="Construction", identification="C")

       # Let's create a new calendar.
       calendar = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_calendar(model, name="5 Day Week")

       # Let's start defining the times that we work during the week.
       work_time = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_time(model,
           work_calendar=calendar, time_type="WorkingTimes")

       # We create a weekly recurrence
       pattern = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.assign_recurrence_pattern(model,
           parent=work_time, recurrence_type="WEEKLY")

       # State that we work from weekdays 1 to 5 (i.e. Monday to Friday), 9am to 5pm
       ifcopenshell.api.sequence.edit_recurrence_pattern(model,
           recurrence_pattern=pattern, attributes={"WeekdayComponent": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]})
       ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_time_period(model,
           recurrence_pattern=pattern, start_time="09:00", end_time="17:00")

       # We associate the calendar with the construction root task. All
       # subtasks underneath the construction work task will also inherit
       # this calendar by default (though you can override them).
       ifcopenshell.api.control.assign_control(model, relating_control=calendar, related_objects=[task])


.. py:function:: add_work_plan(file: ifcopenshell.file, name: Optional[str] = None, predefined_type: str = 'NOTDEFINED', start_time: Optional[Union[str, datetime.time]] = None) -> ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Add a new work plan

   A work plan is a group of work schedules. Since work schedules may have
   different purposes, such as for maintenance or construction scheduling,
   baseline comparison, or phasing, work plans can be used to group related
   work schedules. At a minimum, it is recommended to use work plans to
   indicate whether the work schedules are for facility management or for
   construction scheduling.

   :param name: The name of the work plan. Recommended to be "Maintenance"
       or "Construction" for the two main purposes.
   :param predefined_type: The type of work plan, used for baselining.
       Leave as "NOTDEFINED" if unsure.
   :param start_time: The earliest start time when the schedules grouped
       within the work plan are relevant.
   :return: The newly created IfcWorkPlan

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # This will hold all our construction schedules
       work_plan = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_plan(model, name="Construction")

       # This is one of our schedules in our work plan.
       schedule = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_schedule(model,
           name="Construction Schedule A", work_plan=work_plan)


.. py:function:: add_work_schedule(file: ifcopenshell.file, name: str = 'Unnamed', predefined_type: str = 'NOTDEFINED', object_type: Union[str, None] = None, start_time: Optional[Union[str, datetime.time]] = None, work_plan: Optional[ifcopenshell.entity_instance] = None) -> ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Add a new work schedule

   A work schedule is a group of tasks, where the tasks are typically
   either for maintenance or for construction scheduling.

   :param name: The name of the work schedule.
   :param predefined_type: The type of schedule, chosen from ACTUAL,
       BASELINE, and PLANNED. Typically you would start with PLANNED, then
       convert to a BASELINE when changes are made with separate schedules,
       then have a parallel ACTUAL schedule.
   :param object_type: Work schedule Object Type. Should be provided
       in case if ``predefined_type`` is USERDEFINED.
   :param start_time: The earlier start time when the schedule is relevant.
       May be represented with an ISO standard string.
   :param work_plan: The IfcWorkPlan the schedule will be part of. If not
       provided, the schedule will not be grouped in a work plan and would
       exist as a top level schedule in the project. This is not
       recommended.
   :return: The newly created IfcWorkSchedule

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # This will hold all our construction schedules
       work_plan = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_plan(model, name="Construction")

       # Let's imagine this is one of our schedules in our work plan.
       schedule = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_schedule(model,
           name="Construction Schedule A", work_plan=work_plan)

       # Add a root task to represent the design milestones, and major
       # project phases.
       ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_task(model,
           work_schedule=schedule, name="Milestones", identification="A")
       ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_task(model,
           work_schedule=schedule, name="Design", identification="B")
       construction = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_task(model,
           work_schedule=schedule, name="Construction", identification="C")


.. py:function:: add_work_time(file: ifcopenshell.file, work_calendar: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, time_type: TIME_TYPE = 'WorkingTimes') -> ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Add either working times or holiday times to a calendar

   A calendar defines when work occurs by defining working times and
   holiday times. First, the working times are defined, then the holidays
   may override the working times. For this reason, holidays are also known
   as exception times. For example, you might define the working times as
   every Monday to Friday, then define a few holidays in the year, such as
   the 1st of January. If the 1st of January is on a weekday, it will
   override the work time.

   :param work_calendar: The IfcWorkCalendar to add the work or holiday
       time definition to.
   :param time_type: Either WorkingTimes or ExceptionTimes, depending on
       what you want to define.
   :return: The newly created IfcWorkTime

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # Let's create a new calendar.
       calendar = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_calendar(model)

       # Let's start defining the times that we work during the week.
       work_time = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_time(model,
           work_calendar=calendar, time_type="WorkingTimes")

       pattern = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.assign_recurrence_pattern(model,
           parent=work_time, recurrence_type="WEEKLY")

       # State that we work from weekdays 1 to 5 (i.e. Monday to Friday)
       ifcopenshell.api.sequence.edit_recurrence_pattern(model,
           recurrence_pattern=pattern, attributes={"WeekdayComponent": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]})

       # Let's set some holidays
       holidays = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_time(model,
           work_calendar=calendar, time_type="ExceptionTimes")

       # We create a yearly recurrence
       pattern = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.assign_recurrence_pattern(model,
           parent=work_time, recurrence_type="YEARLY_BY_DAY_OF_MONTH")

       # The holiday is every 1st of January

.. py:function:: assign_lag_time(file: ifcopenshell.file, rel_sequence: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, lag_value: str, duration_type: str = 'WORKTIME') -> ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Assign a lag time to a sequence relationship between tasks

   A task sequence (e.g. finish to start) may optionally have a lag time
   defined. This is a fundamental concept in construction scheduling. The
   lag is defined as a duration, and the duration is typically either
   calendar based (i.e.  follows the working times and holidays of the
   calendar) or elapsed time based (i.e. 24/7).

   A sequence may only have a single lag time defined. Negative lag times
   are allowed.

   :param rel_sequence: The IfcRelSequence to assign the lag time to.
   :param lag_value: An ISO standardised duration string.
   :param duration_type: Choose from WORKTIME for the associated
       calendar-based lag times (this is the most common scenario and is
       recommended as a default), or ELAPSEDTIME to not follow the
       calendar. You may also choose NOTDEFINED but the behaviour of this
       is unclear.

       # for whatever reason.

.. py:function:: assign_process(file: ifcopenshell.file, relating_process: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, related_object: ifcopenshell.entity_instance) -> ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Assigns an object to be related to a process, typically a construction task

   Processes work using the ICOM (Input, Controls, Outputs, Mechanisms)
   paradigm in IFC. This process model is commonly used in modeling
   manufacturing functions.

   For example, processes (such as tasks) consume Inputs and transform them
   into Outputs. The process may only occur within the limits of Controls
   (e.g. cost items) and may require Mechanisms (ISO9000 calls them
   Mechanisms, whereas IFC calls them resources, such as raw materials,
   labour, or equipment).

                 +----------+
                 | Controls |
                 +----------+
                       |
                       V
   +--------+     +---------+     +---------+
   | Inputs | --> | Process | --> | Outputs |
   +--------+     +---------+     +---------+
                       ^
                       |
                 +-----------+
                 | Resources |
                 +-----------+

   There are three main scenarios where an object may be related to a
   task: defining inputs, controls, and resources of a process.

   For inputs, a product (i.e. wall) may be defined as an input to a task,
   such as when the task is to demolish the wall (i.e. the wall is an
   input, and there is no output).

   For controls, a cost item may be defined as a control to a task.

   For resources, any construction resource may be assigned to a task.

   :param relating_process: The IfcProcess (typically IfcTask) that the
       input, control, or resource is related to.
   :param related_object: The IfcProduct (for input), IfcCostItem (for
       control) or IfcConstructionResource (for resource).
   :return: The newly created IfcRelAssignsToProcess relationship

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # Let's imagine we are creating a construction schedule. All tasks
       # need to be part of a work schedule.
       schedule = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_schedule(model, name="Construction Schedule A")

       # Let's create a construction task. Note that the predefined type is
       # important to distinguish types of tasks.
       task = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_task(model,
           work_schedule=schedule, name="Demolish existing", identification="A", predefined_type="DEMOLITION")

       # Let's say we have a wall somewhere.
       wall = ifcopenshell.api.root.create_entity(model, ifc_class="IfcWall")

       # Let's demolish that wall!
       ifcopenshell.api.sequence.assign_process(model, relating_process=task, related_object=wall)


.. py:function:: assign_product(file: ifcopenshell.file, relating_product: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, related_object: ifcopenshell.entity_instance) -> ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Assigns a product to be produced as a result of a process

   A construction task may result in products (e.g. a wall) being
   constructed. These task "Outputs" are defined in IFC through product
   relationships.

   Not all tasks have Outputs. For example, maintenance tasks will
   typically not have any outputs.

   See ifcopenshell.api.sequence.assign_process for Inputs and other types
   of process relationships that can be described in manufacturing
   process modeling.

   :param relating_product: The IfcProduct that was constructed as a result
       of the task.
   :param related_object: The IfcProcess (typically IfcTask) of the
       construction task.
   :return: The newly created IfcRelAssignsToProduct relationship

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # Let's imagine we are creating a construction schedule. All tasks
       # need to be part of a work schedule.
       schedule = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_schedule(model, name="Construction Schedule A")

       # Let's create a construction task. Note that the predefined type is
       # important to distinguish types of tasks.
       task = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_task(model,
           work_schedule=schedule, name="Build wall", identification="A", predefined_type="CONSTRUCTION")

       # Let's say we have a wall somewhere.
       wall = ifcopenshell.api.root.create_entity(model, ifc_class="IfcWall")

       # Let's construct that wall!
       ifcopenshell.api.sequence.assign_product(model, relating_product=wall, related_object=task)


.. py:function:: assign_recurrence_pattern(file: ifcopenshell.file, parent: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, recurrence_type: ifcopenshell.util.sequence.RECURRENCE_TYPE = 'WEEKLY') -> ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Define a time to recur at a particular interval

   There are two scenarios where you might want to define a recurring time
   pattern.

   You might want a task to be scheduled at a recurring interval,
   this is common for maintenance tasks which need to be performed monthly,
   every 6 months, every year, etc.

   Alternatively, you might be defining a work calendar, which defines
   working days or holidays. The working days might be every week from
   monday to friday ("every" week means it recurs every week), or the
   holidays might be the same every year.

   The types of recurrence are:

   - DAILY: every Nth (interval) day for up to X (Occurrences) occurrences.
       e.g. Every day, every 2 days, every day up to 5 times, etc
   - WEEKLY: every Nth (interval) MTWTFSS (WeekdayComponent) for up to X
       (Occurrences) occurrences. e.g. Every Monday, every weekday, every
       other saturday, etc
   - MONTHLY_BY_DAY_OF_MONTH: every Nth (DayComponent) of every Xth
       (Interval) Month up to Y (Occurrences) occurrences. e.g. Every 15th of
       the Month.
   - MONTHLY_BY_POSITION: Every Nth (Position) MTWTFSS (WeekdayComponent)
       of every Xth (Interval) Month up to Y (Occurrences) occurrences. e.g.
       Every second Tuesday of the Month.
   - YEARLY_BY_DAY_OF_MONTH: every Nth (DayComponent) of every JFMAMJJASOND
       (MonthComponent) month of every Yth (Interval) Year up to Z
       (Occurrences) occurrences. e.g. every 25th of December.
   - YEARLY_BY_POSITION: every Nth (Position) MTWTFSS (WeekdayComponent) of
       every JFMAMJJASOND (MonthComponent) month of every Yth (Interval)
       Year up to Z (Occurrences) occurrences. e.g. every third Wednesday
       of January.

   These recurrence patterns are fairly standard in all calendar and
   scheduling applications.

   :param parent: Either an IfcTaskTimeRecurring if you are defining a
       recurring schedule for a task, or IfcWorkTime if you are defining a
       recurring pattern for a workdays or holidays in a calendar.
   :param recurrence_type: One of the types of recurrences.
   :return: The newly created IfcRecurrencePattern

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # Let's create a new calendar.
       calendar = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_calendar(model)

       # Let's start defining the times that we work during the week.

       ifcopenshell.api.sequence.edit_recurrence_pattern(model,
           recurrence_pattern=pattern, attributes={"WeekdayComponent": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]})

       # Let's imagine we are creating a maintenance schedule.
       schedule = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_schedule(model, name="Equipment Maintenance")

       # Now let's imagine we have a task to maintain the chillers
       task = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_task(model,
           work_schedule=schedule, name="Chiller maintenance")

       # Because it is a maintenance task, we must schedule a recurring time
       time = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_task_time(model, task=task, is_recurring=True)

       # We create a monthly recurrence
       pattern = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.assign_recurrence_pattern(model,
           parent=work_time, recurrence_type="MONTHLY_BY_DAY_OF_MONTH")

       # Specifically, the maintenance task must occur every 6 months
       ifcopenshell.api.sequence.edit_recurrence_pattern(model,
           recurrence_pattern=pattern, attributes={"DayComponent": [1], "Interval": 6})


.. py:function:: assign_sequence(file: ifcopenshell.file, relating_process: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, related_process: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, sequence_type: str = 'FINISH_START') -> ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Assign a sequential relationship between tasks

   Tasks in construction sequencing typically have sequence relationships
   between them, indicating that one task must happen after another. This
   is used to automatically compute new start and end dates and cascade
   changes when dates are changed. This is also used to calculate critical
   paths and floats.

   There are four types of sequence relationships, known as finish to
   start, finish to finish, start to start, and start to finish, sometimes
   abbreviated as a (FS, FF, SS, and SF). The most common is the finish to
   start relationship, indicating that the previous task must finish before
   the next task can start.

   You must not create cyclical task sequences. This makes the computer
   unhappy.

   Note that "previous" or "next" does not necessarily mean the task
   chronologically happens before or after. They simply indicate the order
   of the sequence relationship. For this reason, they are often called
   predecessor and successor tasks in the planning profession.

   :param relating_process: The previous / predecessor task.
   :param related_process: The next / successor task.
   :param sequence_type: Choose from FINISH_START, FINISH_FINISH,
       START_START, or START_FINISH.

.. py:function:: assign_work_plan(file: ifcopenshell.file, work_schedule: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, work_plan: ifcopenshell.entity_instance) -> Union[ifcopenshell.entity_instance, None]

   Assigns a work schedule to a work plan

   Typically, work schedules would be assigned to a work plan at creation.
   However you may also delay this and do it manually afterwards.

   :param work_schedule: The IfcWorkSchedule that will be assigned to the
       work plan.
   :param work_plan: The IfcWorkPlan for the schedule to be assigned to.
   :return: The IfcRelAggregates relationship

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # This will hold all our construction schedules
       work_plan = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_plan(model, name="Construction")

       # Alternatively, if you create a schedule without a work plan ...
       schedule = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_schedule(model, name="Construction Schedule A")

       # ... you can assign the work plan afterwards.

.. py:function:: calculate_task_duration(file: ifcopenshell.file, task: ifcopenshell.entity_instance) -> None

   Calculates the task duration based on resource usage

   If a task has labour or equipment resources assigned to it, its duration
   may be parametrically derived from the scheduled work of the resource.
   For example, a labour resource with scheduled work of 10 working days
   and a resource utilisation of 200% (i.e. two labour teams) will imply
   that the task duration is 5 working days.

   If this data is not available, such as if the task has no resources,
   then nothing happens.

   :param task: The IfcTask to calculate the duration for.
   :return: None

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # Add our own crew
       crew = ifcopenshell.api.resource.add_resource(model, ifc_class="IfcCrewResource")

       # Add some labour to our crew.
       labour = ifcopenshell.api.resource.add_resource(model,
           parent_resource=crew, ifc_class="IfcLaborResource")

       quantity = ifcopenshell.api.resource.add_resource_quantity(model,
           resource=labour, ifc_class="IfcQuantityTime")

       # Store the unit time used in hours
       ifcopenshell.api.resource.edit_resource_quantity(model,
           physical_quantity=quantity, attributes={"TimeValue": 8.0})

       # Let's imagine we've used the resource for 10 days with a
       # utilisation of 200%.

       # Let's create a construction task. Note that the predefined type is
       # important to distinguish types of tasks.
       task = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_task(model,
           work_schedule=schedule, name="Foundations", identification="A")

       # Assign our resource to the task.
       ifcopenshell.api.sequence.assign_process(model, relating_process=task, related_object=labour)

       # Now we can calculate the task duration based on the resource. This
       # will set task.TaskTime.ScheduleDuration to be P5D.
       ifcopenshell.api.sequence.calculate_task_duration(model, task=task)


.. py:function:: cascade_schedule(file: ifcopenshell.file, task: ifcopenshell.entity_instance) -> None

   Cascades start and end dates of tasks based on durations

   Given a start task with a start date and duration, the end date, and the
   start and end of all successor tasks with durations may be automatically
   computed.

   Using this automatic computation is recommended is an alternative to
   manually specifying dates. It is useful for doing edits and cascading
   changes.

   Dates can only cascade from predecessor to successors, not backwards.
   Cyclical relationships are invalid and will result in a recursion error
   being raised.

   Note that there may be differences between how different planning
   software calculate start and end dates. Some may consider Monday 5pm to
   be equivalent to be Tuesday 8am, for instance.

   :param task: The start task to begin cascading from.
   :return: None

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # Define a convenience function to add a task chained to a predecessor
       def add_task(model, name, predecessor, work_schedule):

   Creates a baseline for your Work Schedule

   Using a IfcWorkSchdule having PredefinedType=PLANNED,
   We can create a baseline for our work schedule. This IfcWorkSchedule will have PredefinedType=BASELINE
   and the IfcWorkSchedule.CreationDate indicating the date of the baseline creation, and IfcWorkSchedule.Name indicating the name of the baseline.

   The following relationships are also baselined:

   * Same Task Relationships
   * Same Construction Resources
   * Same Resource Relationships

   :param work_schedule: The planned work_schedule to baseline

   * The copy will be assigned to the parent task or work schedule
   * The copy will have duplicated nested tasks

   :param task: The task to be duplicated
   :return: A tuple that consists of two lists of tasks:
