   Assigns a work schedule to a work plan

   Typically, work schedules would be assigned to a work plan at creation.
   However you may also delay this and do it manually afterwards.

   :param work_schedule: The IfcWorkSchedule that will be assigned to the
       work plan.
   :type work_schedule: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance
   :param work_plan: The IfcWorkPlan for the schedule to be assigned to.
   :type work_plan: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance
   :return: The IfcRelAggregates relationship
   :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # This will hold all our construction schedules
       work_plan = ifcopenshell.api.run("sequence.add_work_plan", model, name="Construction")

       # Alternatively, if you create a schedule without a work plan ...
       schedule = ifcopenshell.api.run("sequence.add_work_schedule", model, name="Construction Schedule A")

       # ... you can assign the work plan afterwards.
       ifcopenshell.api.run("sequence.assign_workplan", work_schedule=schedule, work_plan=work_plan)

   .. py:method:: execute()
