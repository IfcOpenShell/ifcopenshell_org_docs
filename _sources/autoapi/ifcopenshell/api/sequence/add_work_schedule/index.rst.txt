.. py:function:: add_work_schedule(file: ifcopenshell.file, name: str = 'Unnamed', predefined_type: str = 'NOTDEFINED', object_type: Union[str, None] = None, start_time: Optional[Union[str, datetime.time]] = None, work_plan: Optional[ifcopenshell.entity_instance] = None) -> ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Add a new work schedule

   A work schedule is a group of tasks, where the tasks are typically
   either for maintenance or for construction scheduling.

   :param name: The name of the work schedule.
   :param predefined_type: The type of schedule, chosen from ACTUAL,
       BASELINE, and PLANNED. Typically you would start with PLANNED, then
       convert to a BASELINE when changes are made with separate schedules,
       then have a parallel ACTUAL schedule.
   :param object_type: Work schedule Object Type. Should be provided
       in case if ``predefined_type`` is USERDEFINED.
   :param start_time: The earlier start time when the schedule is relevant.
       May be represented with an ISO standard string.
   :param work_plan: The IfcWorkPlan the schedule will be part of. If not
       provided, the schedule will not be grouped in a work plan and would
       exist as a top level schedule in the project. This is not
       recommended.
   :return: The newly created IfcWorkSchedule

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # This will hold all our construction schedules
       work_plan = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_plan(model, name="Construction")

       # Let's imagine this is one of our schedules in our work plan.
       schedule = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_schedule(model,
           name="Construction Schedule A", work_plan=work_plan)

       # Add a root task to represent the design milestones, and major
       # project phases.
       ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_task(model,
           work_schedule=schedule, name="Milestones", identification="A")
       ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_task(model,
           work_schedule=schedule, name="Design", identification="B")
       construction = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_task(model,
           work_schedule=schedule, name="Construction", identification="C")
