   Add a new work plan

   A work plan is a group of work schedules. Since work schedules may have
   different purposes, such as for maintenance or construction scheduling,
   baseline comparison, or phasing, work plans can be used to group related
   work schedules. At a minimum, it is recommended to use work plans to
   indicate whether the work schedules are for facility management or for
   construction scheduling.

   :param name: The name of the work plan. Recommended to be "Maintenance"
       or "Construction" for the two main purposes.
   :param predefined_type: The type of work plan, used for baselining.
       Leave as "NOTDEFINED" if unsure.
   :param start_time: The earliest start time when the schedules grouped
       within the work plan are relevant.
   :return: The newly created IfcWorkPlan

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # This will hold all our construction schedules
       work_plan = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_plan(model, name="Construction")

       # This is one of our schedules in our work plan.
       schedule = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_schedule(model,
           name="Construction Schedule A", work_plan=work_plan)
