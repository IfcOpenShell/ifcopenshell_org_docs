   Changes the class of a product

   If you ever created a wall then realised it's meant to be something
   else, this function lets you change the IFC class whilst retaining all
   other geometry and relationships.

   This is especially useful when dealing with poorly classified data from
   proprietary software with limited IFC capabilities.

   If you are reassigning a type, the occurrence classes are also
   reassigned to maintain validity.

   Vice versa, if you are reassigning an occurrence, the type is also
   reassigned in IFC4 and up. In IFC2X3, this may not occur if the type
   cannot be unambiguously derived, so you are required to manually check
   this.

   :param product: The IfcProduct that you want to change the class of.
   :type product: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
   :param ifc_class: The new IFC class you want to change it to.
   :type ifc_class: str,optional
   :param predefined_type: In case you want to change the predefined type
       too. User defined types are also allowed, just type what you want.
   :type predefined_type: str,optional
   :return: The newly modified product.
   :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # We have a wall.
       wall = ifcopenshell.api.run("root.create_entity", model, ifc_class="IfcWall")

       # Oh, did I say wall? I meant slab.
       slab = ifcopenshell.api.run("root.reassign_class", model, product=wall, ifc_class="IfcSlab")

       # Warning: this will crash since wall doesn't exist any more.
       print(wall) # Kaboom.
