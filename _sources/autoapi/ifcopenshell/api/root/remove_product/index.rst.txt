   Removes a product

   This is effectively a smart delete function that not only removes a
   product, but also all of its relationships. It is always recommended to
   use this function to prevent orphaned data in your IFC model.

   This is intended to be used for removing:

   - IfcAnnotation
   - IfcElement
   - IfcElementType
   - IfcSpatialElement
   - IfcSpatialElementType

   For example, geometric representations are removed. Placement
   coordinates are also removed. Properties are removed. Material, type,
   containment, aggregation, and nesting relationships are removed (but
   naturally, the materials, types, containers, etc themselves remain).

   :param product: The element to remove.
   :type product: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
   :return: None
   :rtype: None

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # We have a wall.
       wall = ifcopenshell.api.run("root.create_entity", model, ifc_class="IfcWall")

       # No we don't.
       ifcopenshell.api.run("root.remove_product", model, product=wall)
