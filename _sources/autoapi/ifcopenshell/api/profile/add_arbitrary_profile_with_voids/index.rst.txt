   Adds a new arbitrary polyline-based profile with voids

   The outer profile is represented as a polyline defined by a list of
   coordinates. Only straight segments are allowed. Coordinates must be
   provided in SI meters.

   To represent a closed curve, the first and last coordinate must be
   identical.

   The inner profiles are represented as a list of polylines.
   Every polyline in defined by a list of coordinates.
   Only straight segments are allowed. Coordinates must be
   provided in SI meters.

   :param outer_profile: A list of coordinates
   :type profile: list[tuple[float, float]]
   :param inner_profiles: A list of polylines
   :type profile: list[list[tuple[float, float]]]
   :param name: If the profile is semantically significant (i.e. to be
       managed and reused by the user) then it must be named. Otherwise,
       this may be left as none.
   :type name: str, optional
   :return: The newly created IfcArbitraryProfileDefWithVoids
   :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # A 400mm by 400mm square with a 200mm by 200mm hole in it.
       square_with_hole = ifcopenshell.api.profile.add_arbitrary_profile_with_voids(model,
           outer_profile=[(0., 0.), (.4, 0.), (.4, .4), (0., .4), (0., 0.)],
           inner_profiles=[[(0.1, 0.1), (0.3, 0.1), (0.3, 0.3), (0.1, 0.3), (0.1, 0.1)]],
           name="SK01 Hole Profile")
