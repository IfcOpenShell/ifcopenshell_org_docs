   Calculates the work that a resource is used for

   This is an unofficial parametric calculation that may be done on a
   resource based on careful analysis of the relationships between the
   costing, scheduling, and resource domains in IFC.

   A resource may store a productivity rate in a property set called
   EPset_Productivity. This stores three properties:

   * BaseQuantityConsumed - a duration that the resource is consumed for.
   * BaseQuantityProducedName - what quantity the resource can produce,
       such as area or volume.
   * BaseQuantityProducedValue - what value of that quantity the resource
       can produce during that duration.

   For example, a labour or equipment resource might produce 100m3 of
   NetVolume every day (i.e. 8 hours are consumed).

   Then, if a resource is assigned to a construction task, and that
   construction task is assigned to concrete slabs totalling 200m3, we can
   calculate that the resource consumes 16 hours of work.

   This calculated work is stored against the resource as scheduled work
   under the resource time data.

   :param resource: The IfcConstructionResource that you want to calculate
       the work performed.
