   Regenerate the body representation of a wall taking into account connections.

   IFC defines how a standard (case) wall should behave that has a material
   layer set and connections to other walls using IfcRelConnectsPathElements.
   This function will regenerate the body geometry of a wall taking into
   account the notches, butts, mitres, etc in the wall due to connections with
   other walls.

   A standard wall has a 2D axis line as well as parameters defined in terms
   of layer thicknesses and priorities. The body geometry is defined as a 2D
   XY profile which is extruded in the +Z direction. For this function to
   work, a wall must have these defined and the project must have an axis and
   body representation context.

   For non-sloped walls, a 2D profile is generated and extruded in the +Z
   direction. The profile may be a composite profile, if the wall is split due
   to wall joins along the path of the wall that protrude all the way through
   the wall.

   For sloped walls, a basic rectangular 2D profile is extruded, and then
   additional extrusions are generated for each connection that boolean
   difference the base extrusion.

   This will also update the axis line representation (e.g. trim the axis line
   to any connections).

   The wall's object placement will also be updated such that the placement is
   equivalent to the axis line's start point (which therefore becomes (0.0,
   0.0)). This is a logical, consistent, and useful placement coordinate
   (especially for apps that can pivot using this point).

   All this functionality relies on the Plan/Axis/GRAPH_VIEW representation
   context. It will be created if it does not exist.

   :param wall: The IfcWall for the representation,
       only Model/Body/MODEL_VIEW type of representations are currently supported.
   :param length: If the wall doesn't have an axis length, this is the default
       length in SI units.
   :param height: If the wall doesn't already have a height, this is the
       default height in SI units.
   :param angle: If the wall doesn't already have a slope, this is the default
       angle in radians. Left as none or 0 defines no slope.
   :return: The newly generated body IfcShapeRepresentation
