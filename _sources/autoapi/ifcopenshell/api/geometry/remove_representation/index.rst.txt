.. py:function:: remove_representation(file: ifcopenshell.file, representation: ifcopenshell.entity_instance) -> None

   Remove a representation.

   Also purges representation items and their related elements
   like IfcStyledItem, tessellated facesets colours and UV map.

   :param representation: IfcRepresentation to remove.
       Note that it's expected that IfcRepresentation won't be in use
       before calling this method (in such elements as IfcProductRepresentation, IfcShapeAspect)
       otherwise representation won't be removed.
   :type representation: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
   :return: None
   :rtype: None
