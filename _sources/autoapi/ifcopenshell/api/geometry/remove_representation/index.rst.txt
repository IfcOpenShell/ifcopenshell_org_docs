.. py:function:: remove_representation(file: ifcopenshell.file, representation: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, should_keep_named_profiles: bool = True) -> None

   Remove a representation.

   Also purges representation items and their related elements
   like IfcStyledItem, tessellated facesets colours and UV map.

   By default, named profiles are assumed to be significant (i.e. curated as
   part of a profile library) and will not be removed.

   :param representation: IfcRepresentation to remove.
       Note that it's expected that IfcRepresentation won't be in use
       before calling this method (in such elements as IfcProductRepresentation, IfcShapeAspect)
       otherwise representation won't be removed.
   :param should_keep_named_profiles: If true, named profile defs will not be
       removed as they are assumed to be significant.
