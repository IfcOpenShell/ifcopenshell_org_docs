.. py:function:: validate_type(file: ifcopenshell.file, representation: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, preferred_item: ifcopenshell.entity_instance | None = None) -> bool

   Validates the RepresentationType of an IfcShapeRepresentation

   A shape representation has to identify its geometry using the
   RepresentationType attribute. For example, if it holds tessellated
   geometry, it should store "Tessellation" as its RepresentationType.

   This function checks whether or not the RepresentationType is valid. This
   is a wrapper around :func:`ifcopenshell.util.representation.guess_type`. It
   will then set RepresentationType to the most appropriate value, or return
   False otherwise. In addition, it also attempts to reconcile otherwise
   invalid CSG geometry by unioning all remaining top level items to existing
   boolean results.

   :param representation: The IfcShapeRepresentation with Items
   :param preferred_item: If the type is expected to be a CSG, this will be
       the preferred item to union all remaining items to. If no preferred
       item is provided, the first boolean result will be chosen.
   :return: True if the representation type was set and it is a valid
       combination, or False otherwise.
