.. py:function:: add_shape_aspect(file: ifcopenshell.file, name: str, items: list[ifcopenshell.entity_instance], representation: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, part_of_product: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, description: Optional[str] = None) -> ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Adds a shape aspect to items that are part of a representation and product

   Existing shape aspects will be reused where possible. If the items already
   belong to another shape aspect with a different name, this relationship
   will be purged.

   Warning: it is not possible to add a shape aspect to types (i.e.
   IfcRepresentationMap) in IFC2X3.

   :param name: The name of the shape aspect. This is case sensitive.
   :param items: IfcRepresentationItems that will be assigned to this aspect.
   :param representation: The IfcShapeRepresentation that the items are in.
   :param part_of_product: The IfcRepresentationMap or
       IfcProductDefinitionShape that the representation is in.
   :param description: A description to set for the shape aspect. It's usually
       not necessary.
   :return: The IfcShapeAspect
