.. py:function:: unassign_product(file: ifcopenshell.file, relating_product: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, related_object: ifcopenshell.entity_instance) -> None

   Unassigns a product and an object (typically an annotation)

   Smart annotation objects can be associated with products so that they
   can annotate attributes and properties. This function lets you remove
   the association, so that you may change the assocation with another
   object later or leave the annotation as a "dumb" annotation.

   :param relating_product: The IfcProduct the object is related to
   :param related_object: The object (typically IfcAnnotation) that the
       product is related to
   :return: None

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       furniture = ifcopenshell.api.root.create_entity(model, ifc_class="IfcFurniture")
       annotation = ifcopenshell.api.root.create_entity(model, ifc_class="IfcAnnotation")
       ifcopenshell.api.drawing.assign_product(model,
           relating_product=furniture, related_object=annotation)

       # Let's change our mind and remove the relationship
       ifcopenshell.api.drawing.unassign_product(model,
           relating_product=furniture, related_object=annotation)
