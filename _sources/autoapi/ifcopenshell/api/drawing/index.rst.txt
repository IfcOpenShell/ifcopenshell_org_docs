.. py:function:: assign_product(file, relating_product=None, related_object=None) -> None

   Associates a product and an object, typically for annotation

   Warning: this is an experimental API.

   When you want to draw attention to a feature or characteristic (such as
   a dimension, material, or name) or of a product (e.g. wall, slab,
   furniture, etc), an annotation object is created. This annotation is
   then associated with the product so that it can reference attributes,
   properties, and relationships.

   For example, an annotation of a line will be associated with a grid
   axis, such that when that grid axis moves, the annotation of that grid
   axis (which is typically truncated to the extents of a drawing) will
   also move.

   Another example might be a label of a furniture product, which might
   have some text of the name of the furniture to be shown on drawings or
   in 3D.

   :param relating_product: The IfcProduct the object is related to
   :type relating_product: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
   :param related_object: The object (typically IfcAnnotation) that the
       product is related to
   :type related_object: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
   :return: The created IfcRelAssignsToProduct relationship
   :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       furniture = ifcopenshell.api.run("root.create_entity", model, ifc_class="IfcFurniture")
       annotation = ifcopenshell.api.run("root.create_entity", model, ifc_class="IfcAnnotation")
       ifcopenshell.api.run("drawing.assign_product", model,
           relating_product=furniture, related_object=annotation)


.. py:function:: edit_text_literal(file, text_literal=None, attributes=None) -> None

   Edits the attributes of an IfcTextLiteral

   For more information about the attributes and data types of an
   IfcTextLiteral, consult the IFC documentation.

   :param reference: The IfcTextLiteral entity you want to edit
   :type reference: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
   :param attributes: a dictionary of attribute names and values.
   :type attributes: dict, optional
   :return: None
   :rtype: None

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       text = model.createIfcTextLiteral()
       ifcopenshell.api.run("drawing.edit_text_literal", model,
           text_literal=text, attributes={"Literal": "MY ANNOTATION"})


.. py:function:: unassign_product(file, relating_product=None, related_object=None) -> None

   Unassigns a product and an object (typically an annotation)

   Smart annotation objects can be associated with products so that they
   can annotate attributes and properties. This function lets you remove
   the association, so that you may change the assocation with another
   object later or leave the annotation as a "dumb" annotation.

   :param relating_product: The IfcProduct the object is related to
   :type relating_product: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
   :param related_object: The object (typically IfcAnnotation) that the
       product is related to
   :type related_object: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
   :return: The created IfcRelAssignsToProduct relationship
   :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       furniture = ifcopenshell.api.run("root.create_entity", model, ifc_class="IfcFurniture")
       annotation = ifcopenshell.api.run("root.create_entity", model, ifc_class="IfcAnnotation")
       ifcopenshell.api.run("drawing.assign_product", model,
           relating_product=furniture, related_object=annotation)

       # Let's change our mind and remove the relationship
       ifcopenshell.api.run("drawing.unassign_product", model,
           relating_product=furniture, related_object=annotation)
