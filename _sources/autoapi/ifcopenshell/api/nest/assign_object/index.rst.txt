   Assigns an object as a nested child to a parent host

   All physical IFC model elements must be part of a hierarchical tree
   called the "spatial decomposition", where large things are made up of
   smaller things. This tree always begins at an "IfcProject" and is then
   broken down using "decomposition" relationships, of which aggregation is
   the first relationship you will use.

   Another type of "decomposition" relationship is known as "nesting".
   Nesting is used when an child object is physically attached to a parent
   host object, through a physical predetermined connection point. The
   child object must be specifically designed to attach to a other objects
   at specific positions with a particular form factor. Examples include
   faucets which must always be attached through a predrilled hole in a
   basin. Alternatively, it could be a modular attachment with a
   correlating male and female joint that must join at a particular point.
   Because there is a strict connection point, when the parent moves, all
   nested children must move with the parent. Another example might be a
   predrilled hole in a door panel where hardware must fit through.

   Nesting relationships are not very commonly used in most design and
   construction models. Its main usecase is in modular construction, kit of
   parts, or fabrication models.

   As a product may only have a single location in the "spatial
   decomposition" tree, assigning an nesting relationship will remove any
   previous aggregation, containment, or nesting relationships it may have.

   IFC placements follow a convention where the placement is relative to
   its parent in the spatial hierarchy. If your product has a placement,
   its placement will be recalculated to follow this convention.

   For physical connections which are part of a distribution system, such
   as a plug connecting into a GPO, or a duct connecting to an AHU, or two
   pipe segments connecting with a bend, tee, or wye fitting, you should
   not nest the two objects directly. Instead, you should nest a connection
   port, which determines the type of compatible distribution flow that can
   be connected to it. To do this, do not use this function, but instead
   use the more specific functions in the ifcopenshell.api.system module.

   Note that nesting relationships may also be used by non-physical
   elements, such as cost items or tasks. In this context, nesting means
   that there is an implied order to the child cost items or tasks (i.e.
   task 1 should be shown before task 2). It is not necessary to use this
   function for nesting non-physical elements. Instead, it is recommended
   to instead just use the relevant API functions, like
   ifcopenshell.api.cost.add_cost_item or
   ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_task.

   :param related_object: The child of the nesting relationship, typically
       an IfcElement.
   :type related_object: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance
   :param relating_object: The host parent of the nesting relationship,
       typically an IfcElement.
   :type relating_object: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance
   :return: The IfcRelNests relationship instance
   :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # Faucets are designed to attach onto a sink through a predrilled hole.
       sink = ifcopenshell.api.run("root.create_entity", model,
           ifc_class="IfcSanitaryTerminal", predefined_type="SINK")
       faucet = ifcopenshell.api.run("root.create_entity", model,
           ifc_class="IfcValve", predefined_type="FAUCET")
       ifcopenshell.api.run("nest.assign_object", model, related_object=faucet, relating_object=sink)

   .. py:method:: execute()
