.. py:function:: remove_feature(file: ifcopenshell.file, feature: ifcopenshell.entity_instance) -> None

   Remove a feature

   Fillings are retained as orphans. Featured elements remain. Features
   cannot exist by themselves, so not only is the relationship removed, the
   feature is also removed.

   :param feature: The IfcFeatureElement to remove.

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # Create an orphaned opening. Note that an orphaned opening is
       # invalid, as an opening can only exist when voiding another
       # element.
       feature = ifcopenshell.api.root.create_entity(model, ifc_class="IfcOpeningElement")

       # Remove it. This brings us back to a valid model.
       ifcopenshell.api.feature.remove_feature(model, feature=feature)
