   Add a new cost schedule

   A cost schedule is a group of cost items which typically represent a
   cost plan or breakdown of the project. This may be used as an estimate,
   bid, or actual cost.

   Alternatively, a cost schedule may also represent a schedule of rates,
   which include cost items which capture unit rates for different elements
   or processes.

   As such, creating a cost schedule is necessary prior to creating and
   managing any cost items.

   :param name: The name of the cost schedule.
   :param predefined_type: The predefined type of the cost schedule, chosen
       from a valid type in the IFC documentation for
       IfcCostScheduleTypeEnum
   :return: The newly created IfcCostSchedule entity

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       schedule = ifcopenshell.api.cost.add_cost_schedule(model)
       # Now that we have a cost schedule, we may add cost items to it
       item = ifcopenshell.api.cost.add_cost_item(model, cost_schedule=schedule)
