   Add a new cost item

   A cost item represents a single line item in a cost schedule. Cost items
   may then be broken down into cost subitems.

   :param cost_schedule: If the cost item is to be added as a root or top
       level cost item to a cost schedule, the IfcCostSchedule may be
       specified. This is mutually exlclusive to the cost_item parameter.
   :type cost_schedule: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance
   :param cost_item: If the cost item is to be added as a subitem to an
       existing cost item, the parent IfcCostItem may be specified. This is
       mutually exclusive to the cost_schedule parameter.
   :type cost_item: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance
   :return: The newly created IfcCostItem
   :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # The very first cost item must be in a cost schedule
       schedule = ifcopenshell.api.run("cost.add_cost_schedule", model)

       # You may add cost items as top level item in the schedule
       item1 = ifcopenshell.api.run("cost.add_cost_item", model, cost_schedule=schedule)

       # Alternatively you may add them as subitems
       item2 = ifcopenshell.api.run("cost.add_cost_item", model, cost_item=item1)

   .. py:method:: execute()
