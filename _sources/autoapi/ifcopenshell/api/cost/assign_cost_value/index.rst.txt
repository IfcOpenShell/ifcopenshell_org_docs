.. py:function:: assign_cost_value(file, cost_item=None, cost_rate=None) -> None

   Assigns a cost value to a cost item from a schedule of rates

   Instead of assigning cost values from scratch for each cost item in a
   cost schedule, the cost values may instead be assigned from a schedule
   of rates.

   A schedule of rates is just another cost schedule which have cost values
   but no quantities. This API will allow you to "copy" the values from a
   cost item in the schedule of rates into another cost item in your own
   cost schedule. When the schedule of rates value is updated, then your
   cost item values will also be updated. You can think of the schedule of
   rates as a "template" to quickly populate your rates from.

   :param cost_item: The IfcCostItem that you want to copy the values to
   :type cost_item: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
   :param cost_rate: The IfcCostItem that you want to copy the values from
   :type cost_rate: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
   :return: None
   :rtype: None

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # Let's create a schedule of rates with a single rate in it of 5.0
       rate_tables = ifcopenshell.api.run("cost.add_cost_schedule", model,
           predefined_type="SCHEDULEOFRATES")
       rate = ifcopenshell.api.run("cost.add_cost_item", model, cost_schedule=schedule)
       value = ifcopenshell.api.run("cost.add_cost_value", model, parent=rate)
       ifcopenshell.api.run("cost.edit_cost_value", model, cost_value=value,
           attributes={"AppliedValue": 5.0})

       # And this schedule will be for our actual cost plan / estimate / etc
       schedule = ifcopenshell.api.run("cost.add_cost_schedule", model)
       item = ifcopenshell.api.run("cost.add_cost_item", model, cost_schedule=schedule)

       # Now the cost item has the same rate as the one from the schedule of rate's item
       ifcopenshell.api.run("cost.assign_cost_value", model, cost_item=item, cost_rate=rate)
