.. py:function:: get_basis_curve(alignment: ifcopenshell.entity_instance) -> ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Returns the basis curve for an alignment. This curve is the geometric representation that is used
   as the basis curve for vertical and cant alignments.

   :param alignment: The alignment
   :return: The geometric representation that is used as a basis curve, typically an IfcCompositeCurve, or None if the alignment does not have a representation

   Example:

   .. code:: python
       alignment = model.by_type("IfcAlignment")[0]
       composite_curve = ifcopenshell.api.alignment.get_basis_curve(alignment)
