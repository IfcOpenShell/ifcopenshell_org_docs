.. py:function:: add_stationing_to_alignment(file: ifcopenshell.file, alignment: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, start_station: float) -> None

   Adds stationing to an alignment by creating an IfcReferent with the Pset_Stationing property set to establish the stationing at the start of the alignment.
   Note - this function assumes the stationing has not been previously defined

   :param alignment: the alignment to be stationed
   :param start_station: station value at the start of the alignment
   :return: None

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       alignment = model.by_type("IfcAlignment")[0]
       ifcopenshell.api.alignment.add_stationing_to_alignment(model,alignment=alignment,start_station=100.0)
