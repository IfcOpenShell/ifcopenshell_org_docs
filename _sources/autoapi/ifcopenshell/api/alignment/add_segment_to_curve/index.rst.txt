.. py:function:: add_segment_to_curve(file: ifcopenshell.file, segment: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, composite_curve: ifcopenshell.entity_instance) -> None

   Adds a segment to a composite curve. The segment must not belong to another composite curve (len(segment.UsingCurves) == 0).
   If the composite curve does not have any segments, the segment is simply appended to the curve.
   If the composite curve has segments, the position, ref. direction, and curvature at the end of the last segment is
   compared to the position, ref. direction and curvature at the start of the new segment. The IfcCurveSegment.Transition of the last curve segment is updated.

   :param segment: The segment to be added to the curve
   :param composite_curve: The curve receiving the segment
   :return: None
