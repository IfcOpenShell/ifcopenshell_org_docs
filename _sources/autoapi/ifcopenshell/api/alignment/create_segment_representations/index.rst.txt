.. py:function:: create_segment_representations(file: ifcopenshell.file, alignment: ifcopenshell.entity_instance) -> None

   Creates curve segment representations for the alignment for IFC CT 4.1.7.1.1.4. The alignment is expected to have representations
   for "Axis/Curve2D" (horizontal only) or "FootPrint/Curve2D" and "Axis/Curve3D" (horizontal + vertical/cant). There is the additional
   expectation that there is a 1-to-1 relationship between IfcAlignmentSegment and IfcCurveSegment.
   That is, no Helmert curves in the alignment which have a 1-to-2 relationship

   :param alignment: The alignment to create segment representations.
