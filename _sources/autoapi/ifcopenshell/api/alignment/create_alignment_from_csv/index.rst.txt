.. py:function:: create_alignment_from_csv(file: ifcopenshell.file, filepath: str) -> ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Creates an alignment from PI data stored in a CSV file. Only the business logic
   entities are creaed. Use create_geometric_representation() to create the geometric entities.

   The format of the file is:

       X1,Y1,R1,X2,Y2,R2 ... Xn-1,Yn-1,Rn-1,Xn,Yn

       D1,Z1,L1,D2,Z2,L2 ... Dn-1,Zn-1,Ln-1,Dn,Zn

       D1,Z1,L1,D2,Z2,L2 ... Dn-1,Zn-1,Ln-1,Dn,Zn

       ...

   where:
       X,Y are PI coordinates

       R is the horizontal circular curve radius

       D,Z are VPI coordinates as "Distance Along","Elevation"

       L is the horizontal length of a parabolic vertical transition curve

       R1 and Rn, as well as L1 and Ln are placeholders and not used. They are recommended to have values of 0.0.

       R2 and Rn-2 are the radii of the first and last horizontal curves.

       L2 and Ln-2 are the length of the first and last vertical curves.

   The CSV file contains one horizontal alignment, zero, one, or more vertical alignments

   :param filepath: path the to CSV file
   :return: IfcAlignment
