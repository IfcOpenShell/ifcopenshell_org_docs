.. py:function:: map_alignment_segments(file: ifcopenshell.file, alignment: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, composite_curve: ifcopenshell.entity_instance) -> None

   Creates IfcCurveSegment entities for the supplied alignment business logic entity instance and assigns them to the composite curve.
   End-Start points of adjacent segments are evaluated and the IfcCurveSegment.Transition is set.

   This function does not create an IfcShapeRepresentation. Use create_geometric_representation to create all the representations
   for an alignment. This function only populates the composite curve with IfcCurveSegment entities.

   :param alignment: The business logic alignment, expected to be IfcAlignmentHorizontal, IfcAlignmentVertical, or IfcAlignmentCant
   :param composite_curve: The IfcCompositeCurve (or subclass) which will receive the IfcCurveSegment
   :return: None
