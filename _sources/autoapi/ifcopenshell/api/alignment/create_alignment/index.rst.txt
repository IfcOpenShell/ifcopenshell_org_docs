.. py:function:: create(file: ifcopenshell.file, name: str, include_vertical: bool = False, include_cant: bool = False, start_station: float = 0.0) -> ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Creates a new IfcAlignment with an IfcRelNests nesting an IfcReferent (for stationing) and IfcAlignmentHorizontal. The nest relationship can optionally
   include IfcAlignmentVertical and IfcAlignmentCant. Geometric representations for the alignment layouts (IfcCompositeCurve,
   IfcGradientCurve, IfcSegmentedReferenceCurve) are created as well.

   Zero length segments are added at the end.

   The IfcAlignment is aggreated to IfcProject

   Use get_horizontal_layout(alignment) to get the IfcAlignmentHorizontal layout.

   :param file:
   :param name: name assigned to IfcAlignment.Name
   :param include_vertical: If True, IfcAlignmentVertical and IfcGradientCurve are created
   :param include_cant: If True, IfcAlignmentCant and IfcSegmentedReferenceCurve are created
   :param start_station: station value at the start of the alignment
   :return: Returns an IfcAlignment
