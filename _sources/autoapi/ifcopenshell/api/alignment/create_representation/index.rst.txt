.. py:function:: create_representation(file: ifcopenshell.file, alignment: ifcopenshell.entity_instance) -> None

   Creates the geometric representation of an alignment if it does not already exist.
   This function is intended to be used when a model has only the semantic definition of an alignment
   and you want to add the geometric representation.

   If the alignments are complete, it is recommended that add_zero_length_segment is called after this method to ensure
   the proper structure of the semantic and geometric definitions of the alignment

   :param alignment: The alignment to create the representation.
