.. py:function:: get_parent_alignment(alignment: ifcopenshell.entity_instance) -> ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Returns the parent alignment. When multiple vertical alignments share a horizontal alignment
   the horizontal alignment is nested to the parent alignment, a child alignment is aggregated
   to the parent alignment for each vertical alignment, and the vertical alignment is nested with
   its child alignment.

   Example:

   .. code:: python
       alignment = model.by_type("IfcAlignment")[0]
       parent = ifcopenshell.api.alignment.get_parent_alignment(alignment)
