Module Contents
---------------

.. py:function:: evaluate_representation(shape_rep: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, dist_along: float) -> numpy.ndarray

   Calculate the 4x4 geometric transform at a point on an alignment segment

   :param shape_rep: The representation shape (composite curve, gradient curve, or segmented reference curve) to evaluate
   :param dist_along: The distance along this representation at the point of interest (point to be calculated)


.. py:function:: evaluate_segment(segment: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, dist_along: float) -> numpy.ndarray

   Calculate the 4x4 geometric transform at a point on an alignment segment

   :param segment: The segment containing the point that we would like to
   :param dist_along: The distance along this segment at the point of interest (point to be calculated)


.. py:function:: generate_vertices(rep_curve: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, distance_interval: float = 5.0) -> numpy.ndarray

   Generate vertices along an alignment

   :param rep_curve: The alignment's representation curve to use to generate vertices.
   :param distance_interval: The distance between points along the alignment at which to generate the points
