.. py:function:: add_vertical_layout(file: ifcopenshell.file, parent_alignment: ifcopenshell.entity_instance) -> ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Adds a vertical layout to a previously created alignment.

   If this is the first vertical layout assigned to the parent_alignment the IFC CT 4.1.4.4.1.1 Alignment Layout - Horizontal, Vertical and Cant
   is followed. If this is the second or subsequent vertical layout assigned to the parent_alignment the
   IFC CT 4.1.4.4.1.2 Alignment Layout - Reusing Horizontal Layout is followed.

   When the second vertical layout is added, the structure of the IFC model must transition from one concept template to the other.
   Specifically, the following occurs:

   1) The first child IfcAlignment is created and is IfcRelAggregates with the parent alignment.
   2) The first vertical layout is unassigned from the IfcRelNests of the parent alignment and is IfcRelNests to the new child alignment.
   3) A second child IfcAlignment is created and it is IfcRelAggregates with the parent alignment.
   4) The vertical layout is IfcRelNests to the second child alignment

   For the third and subsequent vertical layouts, a new child alignment is created and aggregated to the parent alignment.

   A zero segment length terminated IfcGradientCurve is created for the new vertical layout

   :param parent_alignment: The parent alignment
   :return: The new vertical layout, including the manditory zero length segment
