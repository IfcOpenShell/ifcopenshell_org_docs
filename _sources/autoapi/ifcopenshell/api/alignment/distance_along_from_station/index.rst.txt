.. py:function:: distance_along_from_station(file: ifcopenshell.file, alignment: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, station: float) -> float

   Given a station, returns the distance along the horizontal alignment.

   If the alignment does not have stationing defined with an IfcReferent, the start of the alignment is assumed
   to be at station 0.0. That is, the station is the distance along.

   .. note:: The current implementation does not account for station equations and assumes stationing is increasing along the alignment.

   :param alignment: the alignment
   :param station: station value
   :return: distance along the horizontal alignment

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       alignment = model.by_type("IfcAlignment")[0] # alignment with start station 1+00.00
       dist_along = ifcopenshell.api.alignment.distance_along_from_station(model,alignment=alignment,station=200.0)
       print(dist_along) # 100.00
