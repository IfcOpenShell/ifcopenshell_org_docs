   Adds a new reference to a library

   A library represents an external data source, such as a database,
   spreadsheet, API, or something else that contains information related to
   the IFC project. Within a library, there will be one or more references,
   such as reference to a particular table or row in a database, or a sheet
   and row or column in a spreadsheet, a URI in a linked data Brickschema
   file, 32-bit decimal BACnetObjectIdentifier in a BACnet system, IP
   address in a network, and so on.

   These references can then be related to IFC elements. You cannot relate
   an IFC element directly to a library, it must be related to one of the
   library's references.

   :param library: The IfcLibraryInformation element to add a reference to
   :type library: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
   :return: The newly created IfcLibraryReference element
   :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       library = ifcopenshell.api.library.add_library(model, name="Brickschema")

       # Let's create a reference to a single AHU in our Brickschema dataset
       reference = ifcopenshell.api.library.add_reference(model, library=library)
       ifcopenshell.api.library.edit_reference(model,
           reference=reference, attributes={"Identification": "http://example.org/digitaltwin#AHU01"})
