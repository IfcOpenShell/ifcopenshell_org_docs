.. py:function:: assign_reference(file: ifcopenshell.file, products: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, reference: ifcopenshell.entity_instance) -> Union[ifcopenshell.entity_instance, None]

   Associates a list products with a library reference

   A product may be associated with zero, one, or many references across
   multiple libraries. See ifcopenshell.api.library.add_reference for more
   detail about how references work.

   :param products: The list of IfcProducts you want to associate with the reference
   :param reference: The IfcLibraryReference you want the product to be
       associated with.
   :return: The IfcRelAssociatesLibrary relationship entity
       or `None` if `products` was an empty list or all products were
       already assigned to the `reference`.

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       library = ifcopenshell.api.library.add_library(model, name="Brickschema")

       # Let's create a reference to a single AHU in our Brickschema dataset
       reference = ifcopenshell.api.library.add_reference(model, library=library)
       ifcopenshell.api.library.edit_reference(model,
           reference=reference, attributes={"Identification": "http://example.org/digitaltwin#AHU01"})

       # Let's assume we have an AHU in our model.
       ahu = ifcopenshell.api.root.create_entity(model,
           ifc_class="IfcUnitaryEquipment", predefined_type="AIRHANDLER")

       # And now assign the IFC model's AHU with its Brickschema counterpart
       ifcopenshell.api.library.assign_reference(model, reference=reference, products=[ahu])
