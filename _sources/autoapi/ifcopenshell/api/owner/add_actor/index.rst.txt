   Adds a new actor

   An actor is a person or an organisation who has a responsibility or role
   to play in a project. Actor roles include design consultants,
   architects, engineers, cost planners, suppliers, manufacturers,
   warrantors, owners, subcontractors, etc.

   Actors may either be project actors, who are responsible for the
   delivery of the project, or occupants, who are responsible for the
   consumption of the project.

   Identifying and managing actors is critical for asset management, and
   identifying liability for legal submissions.

   :param actor: Most commonly, an IfcOrganization (in compliance with GDPR
       requirements for non personally identifiable information), or an
       IfcPerson if it is a sole individual, or an IfcPersonAndOrganization
       if a specific person is liable within an organisation and must be
       legally nominated.
   :param ifc_class: Either "IfcActor" or "IfcOccupant".
   :return: The newly created IfcActor or IfcOccupant

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # Setup an organisation with a single role
       organisation = ifcopenshell.api.owner.add_organisation(model,
           identification="AWB", name="Architects Without Ballpens")
       role = ifcopenshell.api.owner.add_role(model, assigned_object=organisation, role="ARCHITECT")

       # Assign that organisation to a newly created actor
       actor = ifcopenshell.api.owner.add_actor(model, actor=organisation)


.. py:data:: ACTOR_TYPE
