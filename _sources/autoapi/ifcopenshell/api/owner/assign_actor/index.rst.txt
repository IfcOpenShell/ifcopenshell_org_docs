   Assigns an actor to an object

   An actor may be assigned to objects which implies that the actor is
   responsible for. This is most commonly used in facility management for
   indicating the manufacturers, suppliers, and warrantors for product
   types.

   Here are a list of objects you may assign an actor to:

   * IfcControl: Indicates project directives issued by the actor.
   * IfcGroup: Indicates groups for which the actor is responsible.
   * IfcProduct: Indicates products for which the actor is responsible.
   * IfcProcess: Indicates processes for which the actor is responsible.
   * IfcResource: Indicates resources for which the actor is responsible to
       allocate, manage, or delegate. This is not the actor actually using
       the resource or performing the work. For that type of actor, see
       ifcopenshell.api.resource.assign_resource.

   :param relating_actor: The IfcActor who is responsible for the object.
   :param related_object: The object the actor is responsible for.
   :return: The newly created IfcRelAssignsToActor relationship.

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # We need to procure and install 2 of this particular pump type in our facility.
       pump_type = ifcopenshell.api.root.create_entity(model, ifc_class="IfcPumpType")

       # Define who the manufacturer is
       manufacturer = ifcopenshell.api.owner.add_organisation(model,
           identification="PWP", name="Pumps With Power")
       ifcopenshell.api.owner.add_role(model, assigned_object=manufacturer, role="MANUFACTURER")

       # To help our facility manager, it's nice to provide contact details
       # of the manufacturer so they know how to call when the pump breaks.
       telecom = ifcopenshell.api.owner.add_address(model,
           assigned_object=organisation, ifc_class="IfcTelecomAddress")
       ifcopenshell.api.owner.edit_address(model, address=telecom,
           attributes={"Purpose": "OFFICE", "TelephoneNumbers": ["+61432466949"],
           "ElectronicMailAddresses": ["contact@example.com"],
           "WWWHomePageURL": "https://example.com"})

       # Make the manufacturer responsible for that pump type.
       ifcopenshell.api.owner.assign_actor(model,
           relating_actor=manufacturer, related_object=pump_type)
