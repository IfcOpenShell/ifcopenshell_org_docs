.. py:function:: add_address(file: ifcopenshell.file, assigned_object: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, ifc_class: ADDRESS_TYPE = 'IfcPostalAddress') -> ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Add a new telecom or postal address to an organisation or person

   A person or organisation may have associated contact details such as
   phone numbers, mailing addresses, websites, email addresses, and instant
   messaging handles. This information is critical in recording the contact
   information of manufacturers and suppliers for facility management, or
   liable actors.

   There are two types of addresses, postal addresses for physical snail
   mail, and telecom addresses for telephone or internet contact numbers
   and addresses.

   :param assigned_object: The IfcOrganization or IfcPerson the contact
       address belongs to.
   :param ifc_class: Either IfcPostalAddress or IfcTelecomAddress. Defaults
       to IfcPostalAddress.
   :return: The new IfcPostalAddress or IfcTelecomAddress

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       organisation = ifcopenshell.api.owner.add_organisation(model)

       # A snail mail address
       postal = ifcopenshell.api.owner.add_address(model,
           assigned_object=organisation, ifc_class="IfcPostalAddress")
       ifcopenshell.api.owner.edit_address(model, address=postal,
           attributes={"Purpose": "OFFICE", "AddressLines": ["42 Wallaby Way"],
           "Town": "Sydney", "Region": "NSW", "PostalCode": "2000"})

       # A phone or internet address
       telecom = ifcopenshell.api.owner.add_address(model,
           assigned_object=organisation, ifc_class="IfcTelecomAddress")
       ifcopenshell.api.owner.edit_address(model, address=telecom,
           attributes={"Purpose": "OFFICE", "TelephoneNumbers": ["+61432466949"],
           "ElectronicMailAddresses": ["bobthebuilder@example.com"],
