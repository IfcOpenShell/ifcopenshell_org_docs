.. py:function:: unassign_actor(file: ifcopenshell.file, relating_actor: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, related_object: ifcopenshell.entity_instance) -> None

   Unassigns an actor to an object

   This means that the actor is no longer responsible for the object.

   :param relating_actor: The IfcActor who is responsible for the object.
   :type relating_actor: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
   :param related_object: The object the actor is responsible for.
   :type related_object: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
   :return: None
   :rtype: None

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # We need to procure and install 2 of this particular pump type in our facility.
       pump_type = ifcopenshell.api.root.create_entity(model, ifc_class="IfcPumpType")

       # Define who the manufacturer is
       manufacturer = ifcopenshell.api.owner.add_organisation(model,
           identification="PWP", name="Pumps With Power")
       ifcopenshell.api.owner.add_role(model, assigned_object=manufacturer, role="MANUFACTURER")

       # Make the manufacturer responsible for that pump type.
       ifcopenshell.api.owner.assign_actor(model,
           relating_actor=manufacturer, related_object=pump_type)

       # Undo the assignment
       ifcopenshell.api.owner.unassign_actor(model,
           relating_actor=manufacturer, related_object=pump_type)
