   Adds a new classification reference and assigns it to a product

   A classification reference is a single entry such as "Pr_12_23_34" that
   is part of an external classification system (such as Uniclass or
   Omniclass).

   References can be added to almost any object in IFC, including physical
   objects, object types, properties, tasks, costs, resources, or even
   resources such as profiles, documents, libraries, and so on.

   Classification references can be added in two ways. Option 1) specify  a
   custom arbitrary reference, where you have the manually specify the
   identification (e.g. "Pr_12_23_45") and name (e.g. "Door Products").
   Option 2) add a reference from an IFC classification library. The latter
   is preferred if you are using a common classification system such as
   Uniclass, as the library will be prepopulated with all the valid
   classifications already.

   Objects are allowed to have multiple classification references from
   multiple classification systems. This means that adding a new reference
   will not remove existing references.

   References can be inherited from types. This means that if an
   IfcWallType has a classification reference of Pr_12_23_34, then all
   IfcWall occurrences of that type automatically get the same
   classification of Pr_12_23_34. This means that it is more efficient to
   assign to types where possible. If a classification reference is
   assigned to both the type and an occurrence, then the assignment at the
   occurrence will override the type classification.

   :param product: The IFC object, property, or resource you want to
       associate the classification reference to.
   :type product: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance
   :param reference: The classification reference entity taken from an
       IFC classification library. If you supply this parameter, you will
       use option 2.
   :type product: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance, optional
   :param identification: If you choose option 1 and do not specify a
       reference, you may manually specify an identification code. The code
       is typically a short identifier and may have punctuation to separate
       the levels of hierarchy in the classificaion (e.g. Pr_12_23_34).
   :type identification: str, optional
   :param name: If you choose option 1 and do not specify a reference, you
       may manually specify a name. The name is typically human readable.
   :type name: str, optional
   :param classification: The IfcClassification entity in your IFC model
       (not the library, if you are doing option 2) that the reference is
       part of.
   :type product: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance
   :param is_lightweight: If you are doing option 2, choose whether or not
       to only add that particular reference (lighweight) or also add all
       of its parent references in the classification hierarchy (not
       lighweight). For example, adding a lightweight reference to
       Pr_12_23_34 will only add Pr_12_23_34, but adding a heavy reference
       to Pr_12_23_34 will also add Pr_12_23 and Pr_12. These parent
       references merely help describe the "tree" of classifications, but
       is generally unnecessary. Using lightweight classifications are
       recommended and is the default.
   :type is_lightweight: bool, optional
   :return: The newly added IfcClassificationReference
   :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # Option 1: adding and assigning a new reference from scratch
       wall_type = model.by_type("IfcWallType")[0]
       classification = ifcopenshell.api.run("classification.add_classification",
           model, classification="MyCustomClassification")
       ifcopenshell.api.run("classification.add_reference", model,
           product=wall_type, classification=classification,
           identification="W_01", name="Interior Walls")

       # Option 2: adding a popular classification from a library
       library = ifcopenshell.open("/path/to/Uniclass.ifc")
       lib_classification = library.by_type("IfcClassification")[0]
       classification = ifcopenshell.api.run("classification.add_classification",
           model, classification=lib_classification)
       reference = [r for r in library.by_type("IfcClassificationReference")
           if r.Identification == "XYZ"][0]
       ifcopenshell.api.run("classification.add_reference", model,
           product=wall_type, classification=classification,
           reference=reference)
