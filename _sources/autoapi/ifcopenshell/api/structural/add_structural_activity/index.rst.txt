   Adds a new structural activity

   A structural activity is either a structural action or a reaction. It
   may be applied to a point, a curve, or a planar surface, and may be a
   constant load, linear, etc.

   The activity must be defined using an applied load, and associated with
   a structural member.

   :param ifc_class: Choose from any subtype of IfcStructuralActivity.
   :param predefined_type: View the IFC documentation for what valid
       predefined types may be chosen.
   :param global_or_local: The location coordinates of the load is always
       defined locally relative to the structural member the activity is
       assigned to. However, the directions of the applied load may either
       be specified globally or locally depending on how this argument is
       set. Choose from GLOBAL_COORDS or LOCAL_COORDS.
   :param applied_load: The IfcStructuralLoad that is applied in this
       activity.
   :param structural_member: The IfcStructuralMember that the load is
       applied to.
   :return: The newly created entity based on the ifc_class
