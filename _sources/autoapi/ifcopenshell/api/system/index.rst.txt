.. py:function:: add_port(file: ifcopenshell.file, element: Optional[ifcopenshell.entity_instance] = None) -> None

   Adds a new distribution port to an element

   A distribution port represents a connection point on an element, where
   a distribution element may be connected to another distribution element.
   For example, a duct segment will typically have two ports, one at either
   end, because you can attach another segment or fitting to either end of
   the duct segment.

   This will both add a distribution port and automatically assign it to a
   distribution element.

   :param element: The IfcDistributionElement you want to add a
       distribution port to.
   :type element: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, optional
   :return: The newly created IfcDistributionPort
   :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # Create a duct
       duct = ifcopenshell.api.root.create_entity(model,
           ifc_class="IfcDuctSegment", predefined_type="RIGIDSEGMENT")

       # Create 2 ports, one for either end.
       port1 = ifcopenshell.api.system.add_port(model, element=duct)
       port2 = ifcopenshell.api.system.add_port(model, element=duct)


.. py:function:: add_system(file: ifcopenshell.file, ifc_class: str = 'IfcDistributionSystem') -> ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Add a new distribution system

   A distribution system is a group of distribution elements, like ducts,
   pipes, pumps, filters, fans, and so on that distribute a medium (air,
   liquid, or electricity) throughout a facility. Systems may be
   hierarchical, with larger systems composed of smaller subsystems.

   :param ifc_class: The type of system, chosen from IfcDistributionSystem
       for mechanical, electrical, communications, plumbing, fire, or
       security systems. Alternatively you may choose IfcBuildingSystem for
       specialised building facade systems or similar. For IFC2X3, choose
       IfcSystem.
   :type ifc_class: str
   :return: The newly created IfcSystem.
   :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # A completely empty distribution system
       system = ifcopenshell.api.system.add_system(model)


.. py:function:: assign_flow_control(file: ifcopenshell.file, relating_flow_element: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, related_flow_control: ifcopenshell.entity_instance) -> Union[ifcopenshell.entity_instance, None]

   Assigns to the flow element control element that either sense or control
   some aspect of the flow element.

   Note that control can be assigned only to the one flow element.

   :param related_flow_control: IfcDistributionControlElement
       which may be used to impart control on the flow element
   :type related_flow_control: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
   :param relating_flow_element: The IfcDistributionFlowElement that is being controlled / sensed
   :type relating_flow_element: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
   :return: Matching or newly created IfcRelFlowControlElements. If control
       is already assigned to some other element method will return None.
   :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, None

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       flow_element = model.createIfcFlowSegment()
       flow_control = model.createIfcController()
       relation = ifcopenshell.api.system.assign_flow_control(
           model, related_flow_control=flow_control, relating_flow_element=flow_element
       )


.. py:function:: assign_port(file: ifcopenshell.file, element: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, port: ifcopenshell.entity_instance) -> ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Assigns a port to an element

   If you have an orphaned port, you may assign it to a distribution
   element using this function. Ports should typically not be orphaned, but
   it may be useful when patching up models.

   :param element: The IfcDistributionElement to assign the port to.
   :type element: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
   :param port: The IfcDistributionPort you want to assign.
   :type port: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
   :return: The IfcRelNests relationship, or the
       IfcRelConnectsPortToElement for IFC2X3.
   :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # Create a duct
       duct = ifcopenshell.api.root.create_entity(model,
           ifc_class="IfcDuctSegment", predefined_type="RIGIDSEGMENT")

       # Create 2 ports, one for either end.
       port1 = ifcopenshell.api.system.add_port(model, element=duct)
       port2 = ifcopenshell.api.system.add_port(model, element=duct)

       # Unassign one port for some weird reason.
       ifcopenshell.api.system.unassign_port(model, element=duct, port=port1)

       # Reassign it back
       ifcopenshell.api.system.assign_port(model, element=duct, port=port1)


.. py:function:: assign_system(file: ifcopenshell.file, products: list[ifcopenshell.entity_instance], system: ifcopenshell.entity_instance) -> None

   Assigns distribution elements to a system

   Note that it is not necessary to assign distribution ports to a system.

   :param products: The list of IfcDistributionElements to assign to the system.
   :type products: list[ifcopenshell.entity_instance]
   :param system: The IfcSystem you want to assign the element to.
   :type system: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
   :return: The IfcRelAssignsToGroup relationship
       or `None` if `products` was empty list.
   :rtype: [ifcopenshell.entity_instance, None]

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # A completely empty distribution system
       system = ifcopenshell.api.system.add_system(model)

       # Create a duct
       duct = ifcopenshell.api.root.create_entity(model,
           ifc_class="IfcDuctSegment", predefined_type="RIGIDSEGMENT")

       # This duct is part of the system
       ifcopenshell.api.system.assign_system(model, products=[duct], system=system)


.. py:function:: connect_port(file: ifcopenshell.file, port1: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, port2: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, direction: str = 'NOTDEFINED', element: Optional[ifcopenshell.entity_instance] = None) -> None

   Connects two ports together

   A distribution element (e.g. a duct) may be connected to another
   distribution element (e.g. a fitting) by connecting a port at one of the
   duct to a port at the same end of the fitting.

   Ports may only have one connection, so you cannot have multiple things
   connected to the same port. Nor can you have incompatible port
   connections, such as an electrical port connected to an airflow port.

   Port connectivity may be explicit or implicit. Explicit connections are
   where the port connectivity is described for every single distribution
   element in detail. For example, a duct segment would have port
   connections to a duct fitting, which would have port connections to
   another duct segment, all the way from a fan to an air terminal exactly
   as constructed on site. Implicit connections only consider the key
   distribution control elements (e.g. the fan and the terminal) and ignore
   all of the details of the duct segments and fittings in between.
   Generally, explicit connectivity is preferred for later detailed design,
   and implicit connectivity is preferred for early phase design.

   :param port1: The port of the first distribution element to connect.
   :type port1: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
   :param port2: The port of the second distribution element to connect.
   :type port2: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
   :param direction: The directionality of distribution flow through the
       port connection. NOTDEFINED means that the direction has not yet
       been determined. This is useful during preliminary system design.
       SOURCE means that the flow is from the first element to the second
       element. SINK means that the flow is from the second element to the
       first element. SOURCEANDSINK means that flow is bi-directional
       between the first and second element.  SOURCEANDSINK is a relatively
       rare scenario.
   :type direction: str
   :param element: Optionally set an element through which the port
       connectivity is made, such as a segment or fitting. This is only to
       be used for implicit port connectivity where the segments and
       fittings are less important.
   :type element: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, optional

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # A completely empty distribution system
       system = ifcopenshell.api.system.add_system(model)

       # Create a duct and a 90 degree bend fitting
       duct = ifcopenshell.api.root.create_entity(model,
           ifc_class="IfcDuctSegment", predefined_type="RIGIDSEGMENT")
       fitting = ifcopenshell.api.root.create_entity(model,
           ifc_class="IfcDuctFitting", predefined_type="BEND")

       # The duct and fitting is part of the system
       ifcopenshell.api.system.assign_system(model, products=[duct], system=system)
       ifcopenshell.api.system.assign_system(model, products=[fitting], system=system)

       # Create 2 ports, one for either end of both the duct and fitting.
       duct_port1 = ifcopenshell.api.system.add_port(model, element=duct)
       duct_port2 = ifcopenshell.api.system.add_port(model, element=duct)
       fitting_port1 = ifcopenshell.api.system.add_port(model, element=fitting)
       fitting_port2 = ifcopenshell.api.system.add_port(model, element=fitting)

       # Connect the duct and fitting together. At this point, we have not
       # yet determined the direction of the flow, so we leave direction as
       # NOTDEFINED.
       ifcopenshell.api.system.connect_port(model, port1=duct_port2, port2=fitting_port1)


.. py:function:: disconnect_port(file: ifcopenshell.file, port: ifcopenshell.entity_instance) -> None

   Disconnects a port from any other port

   A port may only be connected to one other port, so the other port is not
   needed to be specified.

   :param port: The IfcDistributionPort to disconnect.
   :type port: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
   :return: None
   :rtype: None

   Example:

       # Create a duct and a 90 degree bend fitting
       duct = ifcopenshell.api.root.create_entity(model,
           ifc_class="IfcDuctSegment", predefined_type="RIGIDSEGMENT")
       fitting = ifcopenshell.api.root.create_entity(model,
           ifc_class="IfcDuctFitting", predefined_type="BEND")

       ifcopenshell.api.system.assign_system(model, products=[duct], system=system)
       ifcopenshell.api.system.assign_system(model, products=[fitting], system=system)

       # Create 2 ports, one for either end of both the duct and fitting.
       duct_port1 = ifcopenshell.api.system.add_port(model, element=duct)
       duct_port2 = ifcopenshell.api.system.add_port(model, element=duct)
       fitting_port1 = ifcopenshell.api.system.add_port(model, element=fitting)
       fitting_port2 = ifcopenshell.api.system.add_port(model, element=fitting)

       # Connect the duct and fitting together. At this point, we have not
       # yet determined the direction of the flow, so we leave direction as
       # NOTDEFINED.
       ifcopenshell.api.system.connect_port(model, port1=duct_port2, port2=fitting_port1)

       # Disconnect the port. note we could've equally disconnected
       # fitting_port1 instead of duct_port2
       ifcopenshell.api.system.disconnect_port(model, port=duct_port2)
