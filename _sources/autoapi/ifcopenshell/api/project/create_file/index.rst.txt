   Create a blank IFC model file object

   Create a new IFC file object based on the nominated schema version. The
   schema version you choose determines what type of IFC data you can store
   in this model. The file is blank and contains no entities.

   It also sets up header data for STEP file serialisation, such as the
   current timestamp, IfcOpenShell as the preprocessor, and defaults to a
   DesignTransferView MVD.

   :param version: The schema version of the IFC file. Choose from
       "IFC2X3", "IFC4", or "IFC4X3". If you have loaded in a custom
       schema, you may specify that schema identifier here too.
   :type version: str, optional
   :return: The created IFC file object.
   :rtype: ifcopenshell.file

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # Start a new model.
       model = ifcopenshell.api.project.create_file()

       # It's currently a blank model, so typically the first thing we do
       # is create a project in it.
       project = ifcopenshell.api.root.create_entity(model, ifc_class="IfcProject", name="Test")

       # ... and off we go!
