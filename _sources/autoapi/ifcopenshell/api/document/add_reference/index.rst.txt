.. py:function:: add_reference(file: ifcopenshell.file, information: ifcopenshell.entity_instance) -> ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Creates a new reference to a document to assign to products

   A document may be associated with physical products, tasks, cost items,
   and so on. For example, spaces, storeys, and buildings may have a list
   of associated drawings so you can see which drawings (e.g. plans,
   sections, details) are documenting that location. Alternatively,
   equipment may have associated training manuals, operation and
   maintenance manuals or detailed assembly drawings. Resources may be
   training certification required, schedules may have gantt charts or bid
   documents, and so on.

   In order to associate a document with an object, a reference to that
   document needs to be created. It could be a reference to the entire
   document, or a reference to a particular page or chapter. See
   ifcopenshell.api.document.assign_document for more information.

   :param information: The IfcDocumentInformation that the reference will
       be created for
   :type information: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
   :return: The newly created IfcDocumentReference entity
   :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       document = ifcopenshell.api.run("document.add_information", model)
       ifcopenshell.api.run("document.edit_information", model,
           information=document,
           attributes={"Identification": "A-GA-6100", "Name": "Overall Plan",
           "Location": "A-GA-6100 - Overall Plan.pdf"})

       # In this case, we don't specify any more information, and so the
       # reference is for the entire document, as opposed to a single page or
       # chapter or section.
       reference = ifcopenshell.api.run("document.add_reference", model, information=document)

       # Alternatively, we can specify a single section, such as by a
       # subheading code.
       reference2 = ifcopenshell.api.run("document.add_reference", model, information=document)
       ifcopenshell.api.run("document.edit_reference", model,
           reference=reference2, attributes={"Identification": "2.1.15"})
