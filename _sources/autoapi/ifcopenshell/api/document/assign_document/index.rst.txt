   Assigns a document to a list of products

   An object may be assigned to zero, one, or multiple documents. Almost
   any object or property may be assigned to a document, though typically
   we'd only use it for spaces, types, physical products and schedules.
   Adding a new assignment is typically done using a document reference and
   an object.  IFC technically allows association with a document
   information and an object, but this is not encouraged because it is not
   consistent with other external relationships (such as classification
   systems or libraries).

   :param product: The list of objects to associate the document to. This could be
       almost any sensible object in IFC.
   :param document: The IfcDocumentReference to associate to, or
       alternatively an IfcDocumentInformation, though this is not
       recommended.
   :return: The IfcRelAssociatesDocument relationship
       or `None` if `products` was an empty list or all products were
       already assigned to the `document`.

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       document = ifcopenshell.api.document.add_information(model)
       ifcopenshell.api.document.edit_information(model,
           information=document,
           attributes={"Identification": "A-GA-6100", "Name": "Overall Plan",
           "Location": "A-GA-6100 - Overall Plan.pdf"})
       reference = ifcopenshell.api.document.add_reference(model, information=document)

       # Let's imagine storey represents an IfcBuildingStorey for the ground floor
       ifcopenshell.api.document.assign_document(model, products=[storey], document=reference)
