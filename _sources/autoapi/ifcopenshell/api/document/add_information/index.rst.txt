   Adds a new document information to the project

   An IFC document information is a document associated with the project.
   It may be a drawing, specification, schedule, certificate, warranty
   guarantee, manual, contract, and so on. They are often used for drawings
   and facility management purposes.

   A document may also be a subdocument of a larger document, this is
   useful for superseding documents or tracking older versions. The parent
   is considered the latest version and the children are older revisions.

   :param parent: The parent document, if necessary.
   :type parent: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance, optional
   :return: The newly created IfcDocumentInformation entity
   :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       document = ifcopenshell.api.run("document.add_information", model)
       # A document typically has a unique drawing or document name (which
       # follows a coding system depending on the project), as well as a
       # title.  This should match what is shown on the titleblock or title
       # page of the document. At a minimum you'd also want to specify a
       # URI location. The location may be on local, or on a CDE, or any
       # other platform.
       ifcopenshell.api.run("document.edit_information", model,
           information=document,
           attributes={"Identification": "A-GA-6100", "Name": "Overall Plan",
           "Location": "A-GA-6100 - Overall Plan.pdf"})
