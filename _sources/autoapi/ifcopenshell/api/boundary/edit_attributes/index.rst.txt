.. py:function:: edit_attributes(file: ifcopenshell.file, entity: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, relating_space: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, related_building_element: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, parent_boundary: Optional[ifcopenshell.entity_instance] = None, corresponding_boundary: Optional[ifcopenshell.entity_instance] = None) -> None

   Modify the relationships of a space boundary relationship

   Currently this function is quite minimal and offers no advantage to
   manual assignment of the space boundary attributes.

   :param entity: The IfcRelSpaceBoundary to modify
   :param relating_space: The IfcSpace or IfcExternalSpatialElement that
       the space boundary is related to.
   :param related_building_element: The IfcElement that defines the
       boundary, typically an IfcWall.
   :param parent_boundary: A parent IfcRelSpaceBoundary, only provided if
       this is an inner boundary. This can apply to 1st and 2nd level
       boundaries.
   :param corresponding_boundary: The other IfcRelSpaceBoundary on the
       other side of the related element. The pair together represents a
       thermal boundary. This only applies to 2nd level boundaries.
   :return: None
