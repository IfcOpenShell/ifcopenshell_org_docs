   Adds a new material

   A material in IFC represents a physical material, such as timber, steel,
   concrete, aluminium, etc. It may also contain physical properties used
   for structural or lighting simulation. Note that unlike the computer
   graphics industry, a material by itself does not define any colour or
   lighting information. Colours in IFC are known as "styles", and an IFC
   material may or may not have any style information associated with it.
   See ifcopenshell.api.style for more information.

   A material is typically given a code name which is used by architects in
   elevations and details when tagging finishes. Materials are also useful
   to structural engineers in specifying the exact types of concrete and
   steel to be used in structural simulations.

   In addition, materials can belong to a category. Specifying this
   category is critical to allow model recipients to make simple queries
   like "show me all concrete / steel" elements in the model. Without
   standardised category naming of all materials, this type of query
   becomes a bespoke and inefficient task. A list of categories are:
   'concrete', 'steel', 'aluminium', 'block', 'brick', 'stone', 'wood',
   'glass', 'gypsum', 'plastic', and 'earth'. The user is allowed to
   specify their own category instead if none of these categories are
   appropriate.

   Note that categories are not available in IFC2X3. This shortcoming is
   one of the big reasons projects should upgrade to IFC4.

   Additionally, a material's description provides more information beyond
   its name or category.

   :param name: The name of the material, typically tagged in a finishes
       drawing or schedule.
   :type name: str, optional
   :param category: The category of the material.
   :type category: str, optional
   :param description: A description of the material.
   :type description: str, optional
   :return: The newly created IfcMaterial
   :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # Let's create two materials with their respective categories
       concrete = ifcopenshell.api.material.add_material(model, name="CON01", category="concrete", description="Garage Slab")
       steel = ifcopenshell.api.material.add_material(model, name="ST01", category="steel", description="Corten Steel")

       # Let's imagine an urban concrete bench which is purely made out of concrete
       concrete_bench = ifcopenshell.api.root.create_entity(model, ifc_class="IfcFurnitureType")

       # Assign the concrete material to that bench. Note that no colour
       # "Style" has been specified.
       ifcopenshell.api.material.assign_material(model, products=[concrete_bench], material=concrete)
