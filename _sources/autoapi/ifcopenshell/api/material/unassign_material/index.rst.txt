   Removes any material relationship with a product

   A product can only have one material assigned to it, which is why it is
   not necessary to specify the material to unassign. The material is not
   removed, only the relationship is removed.

   If the product does not have a material, nothing happens.

   :param product: The IfcProduct that may or may not have a material
   :type product: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance
   :return: None
   :rtype: None

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       concrete = ifcopenshell.api.run("material.add_material", model, name="CON01", category="concrete")

       # Let's imagine a concrete bench made out of concrete.
       bench_type = ifcopenshell.api.run("root.create_entity", model, ifc_class="IfcFurnitureType")
       ifcopenshell.api.run("material.assign_material", model,
           product=bench_type, type="IfcMaterial", material=concrete)

       # Let's change our mind and remove the concrete assignment. The
       # concrete material still exists, but the bench is no longer made
       # out of concrete now.
       ifcopenshell.api.run("material.unassign_material", model, product=bench_type)
