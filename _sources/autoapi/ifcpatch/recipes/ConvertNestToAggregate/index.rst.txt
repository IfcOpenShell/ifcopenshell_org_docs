   Convert nesting relationships to aggregate relationships

   Some software like Revit won't load nested children elements because
   they (incorrectly) don't consider it to be part of the spatial tree.
   For example, 12D software will use nesting.

   This patch converts all nest relationships into aggregate
   relationships.

   See bug: https://github.com/Autodesk/revit-ifc/issues/706

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       ifcpatch.execute({"input": "input.ifc", "file": model, "recipe": "ConvertNestToAggregate", "arguments": []})


   .. py:method:: patch()


   .. py:attribute:: file
