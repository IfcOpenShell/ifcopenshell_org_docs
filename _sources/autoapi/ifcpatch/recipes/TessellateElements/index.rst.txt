   Convert element body representations to tessellations or faceted breps

   Some software have bugs that result in incorrect geometry being
   imported for more complex representation types, such as CSGs. This
   patch converts elements matching your query into a tessellation (or
   faceted brep for IFC2X3) which is generally supported by all
   implementations. Note that styles and shape aspects are not preserved.

   See example bug: https://github.com/Autodesk/revit-ifc/issues/707

   :param query: Query string to filter out elements to convert, defaults to "IfcBeam"
   :type query: str
   :param force_faceted_brep: Force using IfcFacetedBreps instead of IfcPolygonalFaceSets,
       defaults to `False`
   :type force_faceted_brep: bool

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       ifcpatch.execute({"input": "input.ifc", "file": model, "recipe": "TessellateElements", "arguments": ["IfcBeam", False]})

   .. py:method:: patch()
