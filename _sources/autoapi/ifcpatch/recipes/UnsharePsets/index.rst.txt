   Create independent copies for shared psets in IFC file.

   In IFC it's possible that same property set is shared by multiple
   elements, so editing it's properties will automatically change their
   values for all those elements.

   Sometimes it's intended but sometimes it's not and it's just the way
   some other software exports IFC (e.g. there is a known case when Tekla
   exports shared psets for all the occurrences).  While it is more
   optimized way to store data, it may lead to unexpected results when
   editing properties.

   This recipe creates independent copies of all shared psets (may be
   limited by the query) and assigns them to the elements, so they can be
   edited without affecting any other elements.

   :param query: A query to select the subset of IFC elements, optional.
       If not provided, patch will be applied to all shared property sets in the model.

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # Unshare all psets in the IFC file.
       ifcpatch.execute({"input": "input.ifc", "file": model, "recipe": "UnsharePsets"})

       # Unshare psets on all IfcWalls.
       ifcpatch.execute({"input": "input.ifc", "file": model, "recipe": "UnsharePsets", "arguments": ["IfcWall"]})
