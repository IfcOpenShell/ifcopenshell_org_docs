   Fix missing or spot-coordinate bugged TINs loading in Revit

   TINs exported from 12D or Civil 3D may contain dense or highly obtuse
   triangles.  Although these will load in Revit, you will not be able to
   use Revit's Spot Coordinate or Spot Elevation tool.

   See bug: https://github.com/Autodesk/revit-ifc/issues/511

   If `is_solid` is enabled, we assume the surface is represented as a
   solid (e.g. I have come across surfaces which are extruded by 1mm from
   Civil 3D). The solution will delete any faces with a Z normal less
   than 0.5. In case the mesh has any side faces or thickness, this should
   leave only the top surface which is relevant for spot coordinates and
   elevations.

   If `is_solid` is disabled, then we assume the surface has no thickness.
   In this scenario, all faces with any normals pointing in a negative
   global Z direction will be flipped. This is because Revit cannot
   annotate backfaces.

   Vertices closer than 10mm will also be merged to prevent dense
   portions of the TIN at a minor sacrifice of surveying accuracy. It will
   also triangulate all meshes to prevent non-coplanar surfaces, and
   delete any obtuse triangles where one of their XY angles is less than
   0.3 degrees.  Therefore the result will contain some minor "holes" in
   the TIN, but these holes will only be in dense triangles that Revit
   can't handle anyway and won't affect most coordination tasks.

   Note that you may may want to run other tools like
   OffsetObjectPlacements or ResetAbsoluteCoordinates to fix large
   coordinates as these can also cause issues in Revit (such as inaccuracy
   or inability to use the Spot Coordinate / Elevation tool).

   This patch is designed to work on any TIN-like export, typically coming
   from civil software. It also requires you to run it using Blender, as
   the geometric modification uses the Blender geometry engine.

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       ifcpatch.execute({"input": "input.ifc", "file": model, "recipe": "FixRevitTINs", "arguments": []})


   .. py:method:: patch()
