   Downgrade indexed polycurves to simple polylines

   Low quality IFC viewers like Navisworks do not support various IFC4
   geometry, such as indexed polycurves. These can result in missing
   geometry or geometric glitches (such as arcs being displayed as full
   circles). This is pretty common when viewing IFCs from ArchiCAD that
   include site boundaries (incorrectly drawn using the ArchiCAD grid tool,
   as ArchiCAD has no site boundary tool).

   This will downgrade specifically the indexed polycurve geometry types in
   an IFC4 model (IFC2X3 does not have this geometry type) to help
   compatibility in viewers like Navisworks.

   Example:

       ifcpatch.execute({"input": "input.ifc", "file": model, "recipe": "DowngradeIndexedPolyCurve", "arguments": []})


   .. py:method:: patch()
