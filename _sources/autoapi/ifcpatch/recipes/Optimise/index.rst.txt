   Optimise the filesize of an IFC model

   It is possible to non-losslessly optimise the filesize of an IFC model.

   Note that this is usually not recommended. Optimising runs a risk of
   losing some indirect semantic data critical for native IFC authoring.
   Most parties who recommend optimisation are not aware of these risks.
   Optimising is only safe in the context of read-only IFCs.

   If filesize is an issue, another approach would be to use IFCZIP
   instead to compress the model. Optimising the model only typically
   affects filesize and has minimal impact on load times. Large filesizes
   can usually be solved through other means. Consult the bonsai Add-on
   documentation on dealing with large models for more details.

   Warning: this optimise recipe is very, very slow. Please consider using
   RecycleNonRootedElements instead.

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       ifcpatch.execute({"input": "input.ifc", "file": model, "recipe": "Optimise", "arguments": []})


   .. py:method:: patch()


   .. py:attribute:: file


   .. py:attribute:: logger


   .. py:attribute:: optimized_file
