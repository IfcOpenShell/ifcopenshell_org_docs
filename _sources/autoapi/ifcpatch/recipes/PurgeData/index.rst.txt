   Purge IFC properties, relationships, and other data

   In some rare cases (i.e. "resetting" a model or for security purposes)
   you may need to purge all relationships and data within a model but
   retain the ability to view the geometry in a model. This patch purges
   the following relationships:

   - STEP comments, which may include software export metadata
   - Header data, which may include filenames
   - Owner, person, organisation, and application data
   - Addresses
   - Rooted names
   - Tags (that reference original software)
   - Properties and quantities
   - Materials
   - Styles (e.g. colours)
   - External references like classifications, documents, libraries
   - Types
   - Groups (such as model groups or search groups) and systems
   - Profile names

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       # Watch the world burn
       ifcpatch.execute({"input": "input.ifc", "file": model, "recipe": "PurgeData", "arguments": []})

   .. py:method:: patch()
