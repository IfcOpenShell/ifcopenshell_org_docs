   Fix missing door swings in Revit when viewing ArchiCAD IFCs

   ArchiCAD has the ability to store 2D data with objects like doors for
   door swings. ArchiCAD's implementation is not 100% correct (using
   footprint instead of annotation contexts), but otherwise not too
   shabby.

   Revit, however, is incapable of understanding this 2D representation.
   Revit users linking in IFCs produced by ArchiCAD may experience the
   following symptoms:

   A. Invisible doors, and difficulty selecting doors
   B. Invisible door swings, or only visible at particular view ranges
   C. Weird arc shapes around doors
   D. Extra lines around doors and walls
   E. Cannot easily change visibility graphics of 2D vs 3D elements
   F. Cannot view 2D data in a 3D view

   This is caused by the perfect storm of Revit IFC bugs, which we will
   work through methodically. For programmers interested in the details of
   how we fix this, read the comments of the patch function.

   Example:

   .. code:: python

       ifcpatch.execute({"input": "input.ifc", "file": model, "recipe": "FixArchiCADToRevitDoorSwings", "arguments": []})

   .. py:method:: patch()
